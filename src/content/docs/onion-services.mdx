title: Onion services
description: Why Anonomi operates independent Tor onion services for its website and code repositories.
---

Anonomi operates **multiple Tor onion services**.

They are not mirrors, proxies, or gateways.
They are **first-class access points**.

---

## Official Anonomi access points

Anonomi is intentionally available on both the clearnet and Tor.

### Clearnet

- **Website**
  - https://anonomi.org
  - Hosted via GitHub Pages (`anonomi.github.io`)
  - Accessible from any browser

- **Code repository**
  - https://github.com/anonomi-org/anonomi-android
  - Canonical source repository

---

### Tor (onion services)

- **Website (onion)**
  - `http://ucvmhctoq76k6qrdrvblxspjpk5rpjutsfe6nxyhgmvx25vruohxrnqd.onion/`
  - Accessible **only** via Tor Browser
  - Hosted independently as a Tor onion service

- **Code repository (onion Gitea)**
  - `http://yexg75vnfxe2q6yygn7csmqdx5mtwmvhrqpboopisvjqz7haras3skid.onion/anonomi-org/anonomi-android`
  - Gitea instance
  - Tor-accessible mirror of the canonical GitHub repository
  - Accessible **only** via Tor Browser

All endpoints listed above are official.

---

## These are **not** Tor gateways

None of the Anonomi onion services proxy or forward traffic to clearnet services.

That means:
- The onion website does **not** proxy, fetch, or mirror the clearnet site at runtime
- Both sites are built from the same source repository but deployed independently
- No onion service depends on DNS, TLS certificate authorities, or clearnet platforms
- Requests are **not** forwarded to clearnet origins

Each onion service is served **directly** from infrastructure controlled by the Anonomi project.

---

## Why we operate independent onion services

### Independence from platforms
Clearnet platforms can be blocked, rate-limited, censored, or pressured.

When that happens:
- the onion website remains reachable
- the onion code repository remains accessible
- project infrastructure continues to exist

No DNS.  
No certificate authorities.  
No platform dependency.

---

### Reduced trust surface
Using clearnet platforms requires users to trust:
- hosting providers
- certificate authorities
- DNS infrastructure
- third-party intermediaries

With native onion services:
- there is no proxy
- there is no intermediary
- Tor connects users directly to Anonomi infrastructure

---

### Stronger project identity
Tor v3 onion addresses are **self-authenticating**.

The address itself is derived from the service’s cryptographic key.
If you trust the onion address, you are talking to **the real service**.

This applies equally to:
- the website
- the code repository
- future onion services operated by the project

---

### Censorship resistance
Blocking clearnet domains is trivial.
Blocking Tor onion services is not.

Anonomi onion services exist for:
- users under censorship
- users under surveillance
- contributors who cannot safely access clearnet platforms
- environments where GitHub or DNS-based services are unavailable

---

## Which access point should I use?

- Use **clearnet endpoints** if:
  - you are browsing casually
  - you are not operating under risk
  - you prefer convenience

- Use **onion services** if:
  - you are in a censored or hostile environment
  - you want stronger anonymity guarantees
  - you want to minimize trust in third parties
  - you want direct access to project infrastructure

If in doubt: **use the onion services**.

---

## Security and privacy expectations

All Anonomi endpoints follow the same principles:

- No trackers
- No analytics
- No third-party scripts
- No embedded external resources

Onion services are especially strict by design.

If you encounter:
- unexpected redirects
- requests to install extensions
- requests to access onion services without Tor

You are **not** interacting with an official Anonomi service.

---

## Verifying official onion services

- Only access onion services using **Tor Browser**
- Bookmark the exact onion addresses
- Be cautious of screenshots or shortened links shared elsewhere

Official onion addresses are published:
- in this documentation
- in Anonomi repositories
- in official release materials

If an address differs, assume it is untrusted.

---

## Operational note

Clearnet and onion services are built from the same source material,
but are deployed and operated independently.

This separation is deliberate.
Anonomi prioritizes resilience over operational convenience.

Anonomi does not rely on permission,
central platforms,
or a single point of failure.

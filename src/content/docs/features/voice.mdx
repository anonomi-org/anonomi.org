title: Voice messages + distortion
description: Send voice messages with optional distortion to reduce voice identification risk.
---

Anonomi supports **voice messages** in addition to text and images.  
Voice can be faster and more expressive — but it also carries **unique risks**.

This page explains how voice messaging works and how **voice distortion** can reduce (but not eliminate) identification risk.

---

## Voice messages

Voice messages let you communicate when typing is slow, impractical, or unsafe.

They are:
- End-to-end encrypted like other messages
- Delivered using the same transport modes (Tor or offline)
- Stored only on participating devices

However, voice carries **biometric information** by nature.

---

## Why voice is risky

Unlike text, your voice can reveal:
- Identity through vocal characteristics
- Emotional state
- Stress, fear, or coercion
- Accent or regional markers

Even short samples can sometimes be used for identification.

For this reason, Anonomi treats voice as **higher-risk than text by default**.

---

## Optional voice distortion

Anonomi includes an **optional voice distortion mode** designed to reduce the risk of voice recognition.

When enabled:
- Audio is dynamically transformed before sending
- Distortion is applied automatically to outgoing voice messages
- The goal is to make voice matching and reconstruction harder than simple pitch shifting

This is a **risk-reduction tool**, not a guarantee.

> Voice distortion does not make you anonymous.  
> It reduces recognizability under realistic threat models.

## How to enable voice distortion

Voice distortion is controlled **per contact**, not globally.

To enable it:
1. Open a conversation with the contact
2. Tap the **three dots** in the top-right corner
3. Open **Contact Settings**
4. Enable **Distorted Audio Messages**

Once enabled, all voice messages you send to that contact will be distorted automatically.

See: **[Contact Settings](/docs/usage/contact-settings)**

---

## When to use distortion

Consider enabling distortion when:
- The contact does not need to recognize your voice
- You are operating under increased surveillance risk
- Voice identification would create personal danger
- You want different behavior for different contacts

You can safely mix:
- Distorted voice for some contacts
- Clear voice or text-only communication for others

---

## Limitations and expectations

- Distortion applies **only to voice messages**
- Incoming audio is not altered
- Distortion does not protect against all forms of analysis
- Strong operational security still matters

For higher-risk situations, consider:
- Text-only communication
- Offline transports
- Panic workflows and stealth features

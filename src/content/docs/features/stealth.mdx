title: Stealth mode
description: Disguise Anonomi as an innocuous app and gate access behind a hidden unlock.
---

Stealth Mode is designed for situations where **the presence of a secure messaging app itself creates risk**.

When enabled, Anonomi disguises itself to reduce suspicion and delay casual inspection — buying you time rather than promising invisibility.

---

## What Stealth Mode does

When Stealth Mode is enabled:

- The app **appears as something innocuous** (a calculator)
- The normal Anonomi interface is hidden
- Access to the real app requires a **secret unlock action**
- The decoy screen remains **functional and believable**

The goal is to make Anonomi blend into the device, not stand out.

---

## Calculator-style disguise

In Stealth Mode, Anonomi presents a **fully usable decoy interface**.

For example:
- A calculator that performs real calculations
- Normal-looking buttons and behavior
- No obvious indication that it hides another app

This reduces suspicion during:
- Casual device checks
- Quick inspections
- Situations where hesitation or refusal would raise concern

---

## Hidden unlock (passcode)

Access to the real app is protected by a **hidden unlock gesture or code**.

For example:
- Entering a specific calculation (e.g. `50 + 50`)
- Performing a defined interaction sequence

Without the correct unlock:
- The app continues behaving like the decoy
- No error or warning is shown
- There is no indication that anything is hidden

---

## What Stealth Mode does *not* do

Stealth Mode is a **risk-reduction tool**, not a guarantee.

It does **not**:
- Protect against forensic device analysis
- Hide network traffic
- Prevent discovery by someone with full device access
- Replace strong operational security

Assume that a determined or trained adversary may still discover the app.

---

## When to use Stealth Mode

Stealth Mode is useful when:
- App presence alone increases risk
- You may be asked to open apps on your device
- You want plausible deniability during inspections
- You need time to trigger panic actions or disengage safely

It works best **in combination with**:
- Screen lock and inactivity timeout
- Panic button workflows
- Conservative connection settings

---

## Relationship to panic features

Stealth Mode and Panic Mode serve different roles:

- **Stealth Mode** → reduce suspicion *before* escalation
- **Panic Mode** → react *after* coercion or escalation begins

They are strongest when configured together.

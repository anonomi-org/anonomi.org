title: Online + Offline connectivity
description: Communicate over Tor when the internet is usable — or go fully offline when the internet is the threat.

Anonomi is built to keep working under pressure — when networks are **monitored, blocked, unreliable, or unsafe**.

This page is a high-level overview of how Anonomi communicates. For exact switches and step-by-step choices, use the linked docs below.

## Two operating modes

### Online (Internet via Tor)
Use this when you need **long-distance communication** and the internet is available.

- All internet connections are routed through **Tor**
- No direct connections to contacts or servers
- If Tor is blocked, **bridges** can be used when supported and configured

### Offline (no internet)
Use this when the internet is **dangerous**, **blocked**, or **not available**.

Anonomi supports multiple offline communication methods that do not rely on external infrastructure:

- **Bluetooth (proximity)**  
  Short-range, device-to-device communication for nearby contacts.

- **Wi-Fi (same network)**  
  Local communication when devices share the same Wi-Fi network, with no traffic leaving the area.

- **External storage (store-and-forward)**  
  Messages can be written to **external storage** (such as an SD card or removable media), physically transferred, and later imported on another device.  
  This enables fully **air-gapped communication** with no live connectivity at all.

## The rule of thumb

- If the internet is usable but risky → **Tor**
- If the internet is the threat → **Offline**

Connectivity choices are part of your **threat model**, not just a convenience setting.

title: Offline app distribution
description: Install and share Anonomi without app stores using local, offline connections.
---

Anonomi is designed to be installable **without relying on centralized app stores**.  
In environments where internet access is unavailable, monitored, restricted, or unsafe,
the app can be shared directly between devices using local connections.

This is not a convenience feature — it is a survival feature.

---

## Why offline distribution exists

Centralized app stores introduce dependencies that are incompatible with high-risk environments:

- Persistent **accounts and identifiers**
- Network visibility into **when and where** software is installed
- The ability to **block, censor, or revoke access**
- Forced updates and remote removals

In many real-world situations, the safest way to install software is **device-to-device**,
without contacting any external infrastructure.

Anonomi supports this by design.

## How offline distribution works

Offline distribution uses **local-only connectivity** between nearby devices.

At a high level:

1. **A trusted device initiates sharing**  
   One Android device starts offline sharing from within Anonomi.

2. **A local network is created**  
   The device exposes a temporary local connection (for example, via a Wi-Fi hotspot).
   No internet access is required.

3. **A minimal local download page is served**  
   The sharing device provides a simple internal download page,
   accessible only to devices connected to the local network.

4. **Nearby devices install directly**  
   Other devices connect locally and download app packages directly
   from the sharing device — without app stores, accounts, or external traffic.

No data leaves the local network.  
No third-party services are contacted.

## App catalog (offline kit)

Offline distribution is not limited to Anonomi alone.

The local download page can present a **curated app catalog**, allowing a complete
privacy-focused toolkit to be shared in one step.

The catalog may include:

- **Anonomi** — the main messaging application  
- **Anonomi Postbox** — companion mailbox functionality  
- **Monerujo** — Monero wallet for private payments  
- **Tor Browser** — anonymous web access  
- **Orbot** — system-wide Tor routing (VPN-style)  
- **Ripple** — panic trigger and emergency signaling app  

Bundling these components into a single offline-capable package
**inevitably increases the APK size**, but ensures users never need to
download critical tools from the internet when it may be unsafe to do so.

This allows devices to be prepared **offline and in advance**, reducing the need
for risky internet downloads later.

## When offline distribution matters

Offline distribution is especially relevant when:

- Internet access is unavailable or unreliable
- Networks are monitored, filtered, or hostile
- Installing from app stores would create risk
- Devices must be prepared ahead of time
- Software must be shared discreetly between people

Typical scenarios include protests, border crossings, power outages,
isolated locations, or environments under heavy surveillance.

---

## Integrity and trust

Offline distribution reduces exposure, but **trust still matters**.

Only install apps from people you trust.  
Whenever possible, verify signatures and checksums before installation.

Offline does not automatically mean safe — it means **controlled**.

---

## What this feature does *not* do

Offline distribution does **not**:

- Hide the presence of apps from device inspection
- Replace operational security practices
- Guarantee anonymity on its own

It removes a critical dependency — centralized distribution —
but must be used as part of a broader threat-aware workflow.

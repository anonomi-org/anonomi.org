title: Crypto payments (Monero)
description: Private payment requests inside Anonomi Messenger, designed to reduce metadata leakage.
---

Anonomi Messenger includes **Monero payment requests** so you can ask for or confirm a payment **inside the conversation** without relying on third-party chat apps, screenshots, or public links.

This feature is designed for **high-risk environments**, where *how* you send payment details can be as sensitive as the details themselves.

---

## What it is (and what it isn’t)

**It is:**
- A way to create a **payment request** and share it with a contact in-chat
- A safer handoff for **address + amount + optional note**, without switching to less trustworthy channels
- A workflow designed to reduce accidental **metadata exposure**

**It is not:**
- A wallet
- A guarantee of anonymity in all circumstances
- A substitute for operational security (see: [Operational security basics](/docs/usage/opsec))

---

## How payment requests work

When you create a request, Anonomi Messenger generates:
- A **fresh Monero receiving address** (ideally unique per request)
- Optional **amount** and **description**
- A **QR code** representation for fast scanning

You send that request to your contact like any other message.

---

## Recommended workflow

### 1) Request inside the chat
Use the in-chat request so you don’t have to paste addresses into other apps, notes, screenshots, or cloud services.

### 2) Receiver scans with a trusted wallet
The receiver uses a Monero wallet to scan the QR code and send the payment.

### 3) Confirm in chat (if needed)
If you need a human confirmation (“sent”, “received”), do it in the same conversation so you don’t create extra trails across platforms.

---

## Why this reduces risk

In real situations, people leak metadata by accident:
- Copy/pasting addresses through keyboards with cloud sync
- Sending screenshots through apps that sync photos
- Using link shorteners, web previews, or third-party messengers
- Switching between apps while under observation

Keeping the request **inside the existing secure conversation** reduces those side-channels.

---

## Security notes

### Unique address per request
Using a unique receiving address per request reduces the chance that unrelated payments can be correlated.

### Don’t attach identity
Avoid writing identifying details in the payment description (names, phone numbers, locations).

### Beware “out-of-band” confirmations
If you confirm payment status via SMS, email, or social media, you reintroduce metadata risk. Prefer in-chat confirmation.

---

## Troubleshooting

### The QR code won’t scan
- Increase screen brightness
- Zoom in slightly (but don’t crop)
- Try scanning from the **receiver’s** phone camera and opening in the wallet

### My wallet doesn’t accept the QR format
Some wallets expect different QR encodings. If scanning fails, use the request’s **copyable address** (if provided) and enter the amount manually.

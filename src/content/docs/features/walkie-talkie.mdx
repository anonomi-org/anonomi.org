title: Walkie-Talkie mode
description: Push-to-talk voice messaging for real-time coordination over Tor or fully offline.
---

Anonomi Messenger includes a **Walkie-Talkie mode** — a push-to-talk (PTT) system that lets you send and receive voice messages in real time.

It works in **one-to-one conversations**, **Private Groups**, and **Open Groups**, both online over Tor and fully offline over local transports.

---

## How it works

Walkie-Talkie mode turns conversations into a push-to-talk channel:

1. **Hold** the volume button to record
2. **Release** to send immediately
3. Incoming voice messages **play automatically**
4. A **status bar** shows who is currently speaking

There is no need to open the app, tap the screen, or navigate to a recording interface. The volume button acts as your PTT trigger.

---

## Where it works

Walkie-Talkie mode is available in:

- **One-to-one conversations**
- **Private Groups**
- **Open Groups**

It uses the same transport as all other messages — Tor when online, or Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and external storage when offline. No servers are involved.

---

## Configuring the PTT button

By default, Walkie-Talkie mode uses the **volume up** button as the push-to-talk trigger.

You can change this in Settings:

1. Open **Settings**
2. The PTT button option lets you choose between **volume up** or **volume down**

Choose whichever is more natural or discreet for your situation.

## When to use Walkie-Talkie mode

Walkie-Talkie mode is useful when:

- You need fast, real-time voice coordination
- Typing is impractical (moving, outdoors, low visibility)
- You are working with a group in the field
- You want hands-free communication triggered by a physical button

It complements standard voice messages — use Walkie-Talkie for real-time back-and-forth, and regular voice messages for asynchronous communication.

---

## Voice distortion

Walkie-Talkie messages respect the same **voice distortion** settings as standard voice messages.

If distortion is enabled for a contact, PTT messages sent to that contact will be distorted automatically.

See: **[Voice messages + distortion](/docs/features/voice)**

---

## Security considerations

The same risks that apply to standard voice messages apply here:

- Voice carries **biometric information** by nature
- Even short PTT clips can potentially be used for identification
- Auto-play means incoming audio will be audible to anyone nearby

For higher-risk situations:
- Enable voice distortion
- Be aware of your physical surroundings when receiving auto-play messages
- Consider text-only communication when voice creates risk

title: Panic button + panic contacts
description: A last-resort safety workflow to erase local state and optionally alert trusted contacts under coercion.
---

Anonomi includes a **panic workflow** designed for situations where you are under coercion, detention, or immediate risk.

Panic features are **deliberately simple** and designed to be triggered quickly — even when you cannot safely interact with the app.

---

## What the panic button is (and isn’t)

The panic button is a **last-resort safety mechanism**.

It is designed to:
- Reduce harm if you are forced to unlock or hand over your device
- Remove sensitive local data as fast as possible
- Optionally notify trusted contacts that something is wrong

It is **not** a magic escape button and **cannot guarantee safety**.

---

## Panic button behavior

When a panic trigger is activated:

- Local Anonomi account state may be **deleted or locked**  
  (exact behavior depends on configuration and platform)
- Ongoing conversations become inaccessible on that device
- The app may appear wiped, locked, or reset

> Panic actions happen locally and immediately.  
> Network delivery is **best effort**, not guaranteed.

---

## Panic contacts

Anonomi allows you to mark specific contacts as **panic contacts**.

When panic mode is triggered:
- An alert message may be sent to those contacts
- Delivery depends on current connectivity (online or offline)
- Messages are sent only when technically possible

Panic contacts are **opt-in** and must be explicitly configured.

---

## How to configure panic contacts

Panic contacts are configured **per contact**, not globally.

To mark a contact as a panic contact:
1. Open a conversation with the contact
2. Tap the **three dots** in the top-right corner
3. Open **Contact Settings**
4. Enable **Panic Contact**

Only contacts with this setting enabled will receive panic alerts.

See: **[Contact Settings](/docs/usage/contact-settings)**

---

## Panic triggers

Panic mode can be triggered by:
- A dedicated panic sidecar app (such as **Ripple**)
- Other configured emergency triggers (implementation-specific)

The goal is to allow triggering **without navigating Anonomi itself**.

---

## What is (and isn’t) guaranteed

**Possible**
- Local data removal or lock
- Panic message attempts to trusted contacts
- Fast execution without complex UI steps

**Not guaranteed**
- Network delivery of panic messages
- Protection against advanced forensic recovery
- Safety after device seizure

Panic workflows **reduce risk** — they do not eliminate it.

---

## When to use panic features

Consider configuring panic features if:
- You operate in environments with risk of detention
- You may be forced to unlock your device
- You need trusted contacts alerted quickly
- You want a fast, low-interaction escape mechanism

For day-to-day privacy, rely on:
- Screen locks
- Stealth mode
- Conservative connection settings

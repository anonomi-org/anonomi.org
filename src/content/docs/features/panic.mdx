title: Panic button + panic contacts
description: A last-resort safety workflow to erase local state and optionally alert trusted contacts under coercion.
---

Anonomi Messenger includes a **panic workflow** designed for situations involving coercion, detention, or immediate risk.

Panic features are **deliberately simple** and designed to be triggered quickly — even when you cannot safely navigate the app.

---

## What the panic button is (and isn't)

The panic button is a **last-resort safety mechanism**.

It is designed to:
- Reduce harm if you are forced to unlock or hand over your device
- Remove sensitive local data as quickly as possible
- Optionally notify trusted contacts that something is wrong

It is **not** a magic escape button and **cannot guarantee safety**.

---

## Panic trigger

Panic mode is triggered by pressing a **custom volume button sequence** that you define in the app settings.

The sequence is a combination of **short and long presses** on the volume buttons — for example, three short presses followed by a long press. You choose the pattern, so only you know how to activate it.

The trigger works **across all screens** in the app, including the stealth calculator. No external app is required.

### How to set up the panic trigger

1. Open **Settings**
2. Go to **Security**
3. Tap **Panic Button Setup**
4. Record your chosen volume button pattern (short and long presses)
5. Confirm the sequence

Once configured, pressing that sequence anywhere in the app will activate panic mode.

## Panic options

When panic mode is triggered, the app performs one of three actions depending on which option you selected during setup:

- **Sign out** — immediately signs you out of your account. Your data remains on the device but is no longer accessible without signing back in.
- **Delete account** — permanently deletes your account and all associated local data from the device.
- **Show a choice dialog** — displays a prompt with three options: **Sign out**, **Delete account**, or **Cancel**. This gives you a final decision at the moment of activation.

You choose which panic option to use as part of the **Panic Button Setup** in **Settings → Security**.

> Panic actions happen locally and immediately.
> Network delivery of panic alerts is **best effort**, not guaranteed.

## Panic contacts

Anonomi Messenger allows you to designate specific contacts as **panic contacts**.

When panic mode is triggered, these contacts automatically receive a **panic alert** from you — letting them know something is wrong without any further action on your part. Delivery depends on your current connectivity and is sent on a best-effort basis.

Panic contacts are **opt-in** and must be explicitly configured for each contact.

### How to configure a panic contact

1. Open a conversation with the contact
2. Tap the **three dots** in the top-right corner
3. Select **Contact**
4. Open **Contact Settings**
5. Enable the **Panic Contact** toggle

Only contacts with this toggle enabled will receive automatic panic alerts.

See: **[Contact Settings](/docs/usage/contact-settings)**

## What is (and isn't) guaranteed

**Possible**
- Local data removal or sign-out
- Automatic panic alerts to trusted contacts
- Fast execution without complex UI steps

**Not guaranteed**
- Network delivery of panic alerts
- Protection against advanced forensic recovery
- Safety after device seizure

Panic workflows **reduce risk** — they do not eliminate it.

## When to use panic features

Consider configuring panic features if:
- You operate in environments with risk of detention
- You may be forced to unlock your device
- You need trusted contacts alerted quickly
- You want a fast, low-interaction safety mechanism

For day-to-day privacy, rely on:
- Screen locks
- Stealth mode
- Conservative connection settings

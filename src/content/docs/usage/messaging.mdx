title: Messaging
description: Communicate securely using text, images, voice messages, payment requests, and offline location sharing.
---

Messaging in Anonomi is designed to work under **hostile network conditions** — online, offline, or somewhere in between.

Conversations are **end-to-end encrypted**, decentralized, and do not rely on central servers. Messages sync directly between devices whenever a viable connection exists.

---

## Conversations

Once you’ve added a contact, you can start a conversation immediately.

Each conversation supports multiple message types:
- Text messages
- Images
- Voice messages
- Payment requests
- Offline location sharing

All message types follow the same security guarantees.

---

## Sending text messages

Text messages are the simplest and fastest way to communicate.

- Messages are encrypted before leaving your device
- There are no servers storing message content
- Messages are delivered when a connection becomes available

If a contact is offline, messages are queued and sent automatically once a connection is possible.

---

## Sending images

You can attach and send images directly in a conversation.

- Images are sent **end-to-end encrypted**
- No third-party image hosting is used
- Images are delivered peer-to-peer

**Safety note:**  
Images may contain metadata (such as camera or location data). Consider stripping metadata before sending in high-risk situations.

> A dedicated page will cover image handling and metadata risks in detail.

---

## Sending voice messages

Anonomi supports voice messages as an alternative to text.

- Voice messages are encrypted like all other content
- They can be useful when typing is unsafe or impractical
- Playback happens locally on the recipient’s device

Some configurations may offer **voice distortion** to reduce identification risk.

> Voice messaging and distortion options will be documented in detail separately.

---

## Sending payment requests

Anonomi allows you to send **private payment requests** inside a conversation.

- Requests are sent as messages, not external links
- Payment details are shared without exposing chat metadata
- Designed for privacy-focused payment workflows

Payment requests do **not** process payments inside Anonomi — they facilitate secure handoff to a wallet app.

> A dedicated page explains payment requests, wallets, and best practices.

---

## Sending offline locations

You can share your location **without contacting external map servers**.

- Locations are sent directly to your contact
- No background location tracking
- No third-party map APIs required

This is especially useful when:
- The internet is unavailable
- Map providers are unsafe or blocked
- You want to avoid leaking location metadata externally

> Offline maps and location sharing are documented in depth elsewhere.

---

## Delivery behavior

Message delivery depends on available transports:
- Online (via Tor)
- Local Wi-Fi
- Bluetooth
- Store-and-forward methods

You don’t need to choose manually — Anonomi uses what’s available.

If delivery is delayed, messages remain encrypted and queued until sent.

---

## What messaging does *not* do

Anonomi messaging:
- Does **not** rely on central servers
- Does **not** store message history in the cloud
- Does **not** silently sync across devices
- Does **not** guarantee real-time delivery

This is a tradeoff made deliberately for safety.

---

## Security reminders

- Anyone with access to your unlocked device can read messages
- Consider using screen lock and inactivity timeout
- Verify contacts before sharing sensitive information
- Messaging security depends on **both** participants’ behavior

Anonomi reduces risk — it cannot eliminate it.

---

## Summary

- Messaging supports text, images, voice, payments, and locations
- All messages are end-to-end encrypted
- Works online and offline
- Designed for hostile environments, not convenience platforms

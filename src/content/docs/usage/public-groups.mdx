title: Public Groups
description: Create and participate in open, decentralized group discussions.
---

Public Groups are **open discussion spaces** designed for broader conversations beyond your direct contacts.

Unlike Private Groups, **any member of a Public Group can invite others**, making them suitable for community discussion, information sharing, and coordination across wider networks — without relying on centralized servers.

---

## What are Public Groups?

Public Groups are:
- Decentralized group conversations
- Open to people outside your contact list
- End-to-end encrypted
- Organized into threaded discussions

There is:
- No central server
- No global directory
- No public search

You can only join a Public Group if someone shares it with you.

## Creating a Public Group

### Step 1 — Open Public Groups
From the main menu, select **Public Groups**.

You’ll see a list of all Public Groups you belong to.

### Step 2 — Create a new group
Tap the **plus (+)** button to create a new Public Group.

Choose a name that clearly describes the purpose of the group, then confirm.

The group will be created immediately and added to your list.

---

## Sharing a Public Group

Unlike Private Groups, **any member can invite others** to a Public Group.

### Step 1 — Open the group
Tap the Public Group you want to share.

### Step 2 — Share the group
Use the **share** option to invite contacts.

### Step 3 — Select contacts
Choose one or more contacts to invite.

You may add an optional message explaining what the group is about before sending the invitation.

Invited contacts will receive a message allowing them to join.

## Joining a Public Group

You can join a Public Group if:
- Someone shares it with you
- You receive a group invitation

Once accepted, the group will appear in your Public Groups list and begin syncing messages.

---

## Posting and reading messages

Public Group conversations are **thread-based**:

- Anyone can start a new thread
- Anyone can reply to existing threads
- Threads help keep discussions organized

There are no admins, moderators, or hierarchy enforced by the protocol.

---

## Current feature limitations

At this time, Public Groups support **text messages only**.

The following features are **not available** in Public Groups:
- ❌ Images
- ❌ Voice messages
- ❌ Payment requests
- ❌ Offline location sharing

These limits are intentional and may evolve over time.

---

## Leaving a Public Group

Any member — including the creator — can leave a Public Group at any time.

- Leaving stops future message syncing
- Messages already received remain on your device
- Other members are not explicitly notified

A Public Group continues to exist **as long as at least one member remains**.  
When the last member leaves, the group disappears.

---

## Security and trust considerations

Public Groups operate under **lower trust assumptions** than private conversations.

Keep in mind:
- Anyone in the group can read what you post
- Group membership is visible to other members
- Messages may persist on other devices indefinitely
- There is no identity verification beyond invitations

**Do not share sensitive personal, operational, or identifying information** in Public Groups.

Public Groups are for discussion — not secrecy.

## Public vs Private Groups

| Use case | Recommended |
|--------|------------|
| Trusted coordination | Private Groups |
| Community discussion | Public Groups |
| Sensitive planning | One-to-one chats |
| Broad information sharing | Public Groups |

Choose the smallest trust surface that fits your needs.

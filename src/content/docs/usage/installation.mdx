description: Install Anonomi safely — via verified downloads or fully offline sharing.
---

Anonomi is designed to be installable even when app stores are blocked, unsafe, or unavailable.

This page explains the supported installation paths and the checks you should perform before running any APK — especially in higher-risk environments.

---

## Choose your install path

### Option 1: Official releases (recommended)
Download the signed APK from the official project release channel and **verify it before installing**.

**Typical workflow**
1. Download the APK from the official releases page.
2. Verify the file (checksum/signature).
3. Install.
4. Revoke any temporary “unknown apps” permission you enabled.

- See: **[Downloads](/docs/downloads)**
- See: **[Verify downloads](/docs/verify)**

### Option 2: Fully offline distribution (when the internet is the threat)
If the network is monitored, blocked, or dangerous, Anonomi can be shared **device-to-device** using local connections — with no external traffic.

This allows installation without app stores, mirrors, or public downloads.

- See: **[Offline app distribution](/docs/features/distribution)**

### App stores (not available yet)
Anonomi is not currently published in any app stores.

When this changes, the documentation will be updated with the official listing(s). Until then, **verified direct installs and offline sharing are the supported methods**.

## Install from an APK (Android)

### Step 1 — Download the APK
- Prefer downloading over a connection you trust.
- Avoid third-party APK sites unless you can independently verify integrity.

### Step 2 — Verify before installing
In higher-risk environments, verification should be treated as mandatory.

- Follow: **[Verify downloads](/docs/verify)**

### Step 3 — Allow “unknown apps” (temporarily)
Android may block installs that don’t come from an app store.

Enable the permission **only for the app doing the install** (browser or file manager), install Anonomi, then disable it again.

### Step 4 — Install and open
Once installation completes, open Anonomi and continue with setup:

## Updates

Anonomi does not rely on silent or automatic updates.

Updates are installed by downloading the new APK and installing it over the existing one.  
Android will treat this as an update **only if the signing key matches**.

If you installed Anonomi via offline distribution, update using the same method with a newer APK.

---

## Troubleshooting

### I can’t install the APK
- Try a different browser or file manager.
- Ensure the “unknown apps” permission is enabled for the installer app.
- Confirm the file downloaded completely.

### The app installs but won’t open
- Verify you installed the correct build for your device.
- Re-check file integrity.
- Device management policies (work profiles / MDM) may block sideloaded apps.

## Safety notes

- **Your account lives on your device.** If you uninstall the app or lose access to the device, recovery may not be possible.
- In high-risk situations, installing from a **trusted offline share** may be safer than downloading over a watched network.

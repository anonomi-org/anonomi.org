title: Contact Settings
description: Customize how Anonomi behaves for an individual contact.
---

Each contact in Anonomi has its own **Contact Settings**.  
These settings let you tailor behavior **per person**, rather than applying global rules.

To access Contact Settings:
1. Open a conversation with a contact
2. Tap the **three dots** in the top-right corner
3. Select **Contact Settings**

---

## Contact name

You can assign a **custom name** to a contact.

- This name is only visible to you
- It does not affect the contact’s identity or cryptographic keys
- Changing the name does not notify the contact

Use this to:
- Replace temporary or unclear names
- Use aliases instead of real names
- Organize contacts safely if your device is inspected

---

## Panic contact

When **Panic Contact** is enabled, this contact becomes part of your panic workflow.

If panic mode is triggered:
- This contact may receive a **panic message** (when delivery is possible)
- The message is intended to signal distress or coercion
- Delivery depends on connectivity at the time (online or offline)

**Important notes**
- Panic messages are best-effort, not guaranteed
- Enabling this does not expose the contact unless panic mode is triggered
- Choose panic contacts carefully

## Distorted audio messages

When enabled, **audio messages sent to this contact are distorted**.

This provides:
- Reduced voice recognizability
- Additional protection against voice identification
- A different risk profile than clear voice messages

Things to keep in mind:
- Distortion applies only to **audio messages**
- Text messages are unaffected
- Distortion is applied automatically when sending

Use this for contacts where voice identification would increase risk.

## Per-contact control

Contact Settings allow you to:
- Treat different contacts with different risk assumptions
- Combine safety features selectively
- Avoid one-size-fits-all behavior

This is intentional: **trust and threat models differ per relationship**.

title: Operational security basics
description: Practical habits that matter more than settings when using Anonomi.
---

Anonomi is designed to reduce **technical exposure**.  
Operational security (OPSEC) is about reducing **human mistakes**.

No app can make unsafe behavior safe. This page explains how to use Anonomi in ways that don’t undermine its design.

---

## What OPSEC means here

Operational security is not about paranoia or perfection.

It’s about:
- choosing *when* to communicate
- choosing *how* to connect
- understanding *what the app does not protect*

Anonomi gives you options. OPSEC is how you use them.

---

## Your device is the weakest link

If your device is compromised, Anonomi cannot protect you.

Assume risk if:
- Your phone is rooted, jailbroken, or running unknown software
- Someone else has had unsupervised access to it
- The operating system is outdated or modified
- The device can be seized or inspected

**Basic discipline**
- Use a device lock (PIN, password, or biometric)
- Keep physical control of your device
- Treat lost or seized devices as compromised

---

## Identity separation matters

Contacts are not permanent trust relationships.

Even without real names:
- Writing style
- Time patterns
- Voice characteristics
- Profile images

…can link identities over time.

**Good practice**
- Avoid reusing names, photos, or phrases across platforms
- Don’t assume contacts remain safe forever
- Remove contacts that no longer need access

---

## Connectivity is a decision, not a default

Anonomi supports multiple connection modes because **no single mode is always safe**.

Before communicating, decide:
- Is the internet usable but risky?
- Or is the internet itself the threat?

**Rule of thumb**
- Internet usable → **Tor**
- Internet dangerous → **Offline modes**

Don’t “just try online” out of habit.

## Say less, not more

Messages can outlive context.

Even encrypted messages can:
- be shown under coercion
- be misinterpreted later
- resurface when devices are compromised

**Safer habits**
- Keep messages short and specific
- Avoid unnecessary context
- Don’t send anything you wouldn’t carry physically

Silence is often safer than clarification.

---

## Features reduce risk — they don’t remove it

Security features are **risk reduction tools**, not guarantees.

- **Panic button** helps under pressure, but may not erase everything instantly
- **Stealth mode** hides the app, not its existence
- **Voice distortion** reduces recognition risk, not identity certainty
- **Offline modes** reduce network exposure, not device exposure

Use features intentionally, not as a safety net.

---

## Assume pressure, not ideal conditions

Design your behavior for:
- stress
- fatigue
- time pressure
- mistakes

Avoid plans that only work when everything goes right.

**Good defaults**
- Prepare settings in advance
- Keep fallback options
- Know when *not* to communicate

---

## When in doubt

If something feels unsafe:
- Pause
- Go offline
- Say less
- Delay sending

You don’t need perfect certainty to choose caution.

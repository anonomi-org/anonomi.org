title: Scenarios and transport tradeoffs
description: Practical ways to choose Tor, local offline modes, or store-and-forward depending on the risk.
---

This page assumes you’ve read the [Threat model](/docs/security/threat-model).

Anonomi supports multiple ways to communicate because **real risk isn’t one-size-fits-all**.

Use this page to pick a mode based on your constraints: **surveillance**, **blocking**, **no internet**, **time pressure**, and **device risk**.

## Quick chooser

**Use Tor (online) when**
- You need distance communication (not in the same area)
- The internet is available (even if monitored)
- You can reach Tor directly or through bridges

**Use Wi-Fi (offline) when**
- You’re coordinating inside a local area
- The internet is unreliable or dangerous
- You want **zero external network traffic**

**Use Bluetooth (offline) when**
- You’re nearby (small range is OK)
- You can’t rely on Wi-Fi infrastructure
- You want a low-profile local link

**Use External storage (store-and-forward) when**
- Live communication is too risky
- You must cross a boundary (checkpoint, border, device inspections)
- You need a workflow that works without any live network connection

## Scenario 1: Internet is monitored, but not blocked

**Goal:** communicate long-distance while reducing exposure.

**Recommended**
- **Tor (online)**

**Why**
- Shifts traffic away from direct, linkable connections.

**Do**
- Use Tor with bridges if needed.
- Keep conversations minimal and purposeful.
- Avoid unnecessary online activity on the same device.

---

## Scenario 2: Internet shutdown, local coordination needed

**Goal:** keep messaging inside a building / camp / neighborhood.

**Recommended**
- **Wi-Fi (offline)** first
- **Bluetooth (offline)** if Wi-Fi isn’t possible

**Why**
- No dependency on external infrastructure.

**Do**
- Decide a meeting point / range expectation.
- Keep devices charged; offline networking is still power-consuming.

---

## Scenario 3: Tor is blocked, surveillance is high

**Goal:** communicate online despite blocking.

**Recommended**
- **Tor (online) with bridges**
- If bridges fail: fall back to **offline modes** until safe

**Why**
- Bridges are designed for censorship resistance.
- If the network is actively hostile, offline can be safer than “trying harder” online.

**Do**
- Prepare bridge options ahead of time (when safe).
- Don’t improvise under pressure if it increases exposure.

---

## Scenario 4: Checkpoints, searches, or device inspection risk

**Goal:** move messages across a boundary without live connectivity.

**Recommended**
- **External storage (store-and-forward)**

**Why**
- Avoids live network activity when it could be used as evidence or a trigger.
- Keeps the “communication act” separated from hostile infrastructure.

**Do**
- Treat handoff media as sensitive.
- Minimize what you carry and when.
- Assume devices can be inspected.

---

## Scenario 5: Protest / street conditions (fast movement, unstable links)

**Goal:** keep comms working while moving.

**Recommended**
- **Bluetooth (offline)** for proximity groups
- **Wi-Fi (offline)** if you can maintain a shared local network

**Why**
- Fast, local coordination matters more than perfect connectivity.

**Do**
- Keep group sizes small.
- Decide fallbacks (rally point + time window).

---

## Scenario 6: Distribution without app stores

**Goal:** install or share the app without relying on centralized stores.

**Recommended**
- **Offline distribution** (local sharing)

**Why**
- Avoids forcing people to download from risky networks or store accounts.

**Do**
- Prefer verified releases.
- Use the distribution workflow described in the docs.

---

## Principles that hold in every scenario

- **Pre-plan**: decide modes before the situation escalates.
- **Minimize exposure**: fewer actions, fewer traces.
- **Assume compromise**: devices can be seized; contacts can be pressured.
- **Don’t chase perfect**: pick the safest workable option.

title: Deleting Contacts
description: Remove contacts safely without notifying them.
---

Deleting a contact in Anonomi permanently removes the communication relationship **on your device**.

The other person is **not notified**. From their perspective, you will simply appear offline.

---

## Deleting a contact

### Step 1 — Open your contact list
Go to the main contact list and locate the contact you want to remove.

### Step 2 — Open the contact menu
Tap the contact’s name to open their profile or conversation menu.

### Step 3 — Delete the contact
Select **Delete contact** and confirm when prompted.

The contact will be removed immediately.

## What happens when you delete a contact

When a contact is deleted:

- You can no longer send or receive messages from them
- They are removed from your contact list
- Any future connection attempts are stopped
- Existing messages remain only on your device

The deleted contact:
- Is **not notified**
- Will not receive a “removed” message
- Will simply see you as offline or unreachable

This behavior is intentional.

## Privacy and safety considerations

Deleting contacts silently protects you in situations where:
- You need to reduce your contact surface quickly
- You no longer trust a contact
- A device may be inspected or compromised
- You want to disengage without escalation

Anonomi does not provide:
- “Block” notifications
- Read receipts for deletion
- Any remote control over the other device

Once deleted, the relationship is over **from your side only**.

---

## Important notes

- Deleting a contact is **not reversible**
- To reconnect, you must add the contact again from scratch
- Past conversations may still exist on the other person’s device
- Deleting a contact does **not** delete any Public or Private Groups you share

If you need to limit exposure inside groups, leave the group separately.

## When to delete a contact

Consider deleting a contact if:
- Trust assumptions change
- A device may be searched or seized
- A contact’s behavior becomes risky
- You no longer need the connection

Minimizing unnecessary contacts reduces long-term metadata exposure.

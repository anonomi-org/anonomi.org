title: Private Groups
description: Create encrypted group conversations with trusted contacts.
---

Private Groups allow you to communicate securely with **multiple trusted contacts** at once.

They are designed for **small, trusted circles** — not public broadcasting — and inherit the same decentralized, end-to-end encrypted properties as one-to-one conversations.

---

## What are Private Groups?

A Private Group is an encrypted group conversation where:
- All members must already be your contacts
- Messages are end-to-end encrypted
- There are no central servers
- Group membership is controlled explicitly

Private Groups are suitable for:
- Trusted teams
- Families or close networks
- Coordination in hostile environments

## Creating a private group

### Step 1 — Open Private Groups
Open the main menu and select **Private Groups**.

You’ll see a list of all private groups you belong to.

### Step 2 — Create a new group
Tap the **Create Group** button.

Enter a name for the group and confirm.

### Step 3 — Invite contacts
Choose the contacts you want to invite to the group.

Only contacts already in your contact list can be invited.

### Step 4 — Send invitations
Optionally add a short message explaining the purpose of the group, then send the invitations.

Invited contacts will receive a request to join.

## Joining a private group

When someone invites you to a private group:
- You’ll see an invitation message
- You can accept or decline
- If you accept, the group appears in your Private Groups list

No one is added automatically — joining always requires explicit consent.

---

## Group conversations

Once a group is created and members have joined, you can start messaging.

### Threads
Messages in private groups are organized into **threads**:
- Anyone can start a new thread
- Anyone can reply within an existing thread

This helps keep discussions readable as groups grow.

## Current feature limitations

At this time, **Private Groups support text messages only**.

The following features are **not yet available in groups**:
- ❌ Images
- ❌ Voice messages
- ❌ Payment requests
- ❌ Offline location sharing

These features may be added in the future, but are intentionally limited during early stages to keep group communication simple and robust.

---

## Group permissions and lifecycle

- **Only the group creator can invite new members**
- Any member can leave the group at any time
- If the **creator leaves**, the group is automatically dissolved
- There is no concept of group administrators or moderators beyond the creator

This design avoids hidden authority and reduces long-term metadata exposure.

---

## Security notes

- Group members can see who else is in the group
- Trust assumptions apply to *all* members
- Leaving a group does not delete past messages from other members’ devices
- Anyone with physical access to an unlocked device can read group messages

Private Groups are powerful — but only as safe as the people inside them.

## Summary

- Private Groups are encrypted, invite-only group chats
- Designed for trusted contacts
- Text messaging only (for now)
- No servers, no public discovery
- Explicit membership control

title: Connections
description: Control how Anonomi connects — locally, over Tor, or not at all.
---

The **Connections** settings control *how* Anonomi is allowed to communicate.

These options don’t change who you talk to or what you say — they define **which network paths are permitted**, and when. Choosing the right combination is part of your threat model.

Anonomi is designed to keep working when networks are **blocked, monitored, unreliable, or intentionally avoided**.

---

## Connection strategy

Before touching any toggles, decide one thing:

- **If the internet is usable but risky → use Tor**
- **If the internet is the threat → go offline**

Anonomi does not assume that being online is always safe.

---

## Local connections (offline)

Local connections allow communication **without any internet access**. No traffic leaves the area.

### Connect via Bluetooth

When enabled, Anonomi can communicate directly with nearby devices using Bluetooth.

**Use Bluetooth when**
- Contacts are physically nearby
- Wi-Fi infrastructure is unavailable or unsafe
- Short range is a feature (not a limitation)

**Tradeoffs**
- Very limited range
- Lower throughput than Wi-Fi

Turning this off prevents any Bluetooth-based communication.

---

### Connect on the same Wi-Fi network

When enabled, Anonomi can communicate with contacts on the same local Wi-Fi network.

**Use Wi-Fi when**
- Devices share a trusted local network
- Internet shutdowns are in effect
- You need higher throughput than Bluetooth

**Tradeoffs**
- Limited to the local network
- Requires shared Wi-Fi access

Turning this off ensures no local Wi-Fi traffic is used.

---

## Internet connections (Tor)

When Anonomi connects to the internet, it does so **only through the Tor network**.

Tor routes traffic through multiple volunteer-run relays, helping reduce traceability, censorship, and network-level metadata exposure.

### Connect via the Internet

This toggle controls whether *any* internet connectivity is allowed.

- **Enabled**: Anonomi may connect over Tor
- **Disabled**: All internet connections are blocked

When disabled, Anonomi operates strictly in offline modes.

---

### Connection method for Tor network

You can control *how* Tor is reached:

- **Automatic (recommended)**  
  Anonomi selects the safest configuration for your environment.

- **Use Tor without bridges**  
  Connects directly to the Tor network.  
  Best when Tor is reachable and not blocked.

- **Use Tor with bridges**  
  Uses Tor bridges to bypass censorship.  
  Recommended in restricted or high-control networks.

- **Don’t connect**  
  Completely disables Tor connectivity.

Choosing the wrong mode can prevent connections — choosing the right one can be the difference between working and being blocked.

---

## Mobile data control

You can decide whether Anonomi is allowed to use **mobile data**.

- **Enabled**: Tor may use mobile data or Wi-Fi
- **Disabled**: Internet connections only occur over Wi-Fi

This is useful when:
- Mobile networks are monitored
- Data usage itself creates risk
- You want predictable connectivity behavior

---

## Connect only when charging

When enabled, Anonomi will only use the internet while the device is **plugged in**.

This helps:
- Reduce battery drain
- Avoid unexpected Tor traffic while moving
- Make network usage more deliberate

Offline connections (Bluetooth / Wi-Fi) are not affected.

---

## External storage (store-and-forward)

Anonomi also supports carrying messages across boundaries using removable storage or file transfer.

**Best for**
- Checkpoints or border crossings
- Air-gapped workflows
- Situations where live connectivity is too dangerous

**Tradeoffs**
- Manual process
- Requires strong operational discipline

---

## Switching modes safely

- **Decide early** — don’t improvise under pressure
- **Minimize exposure** — disable internet when you don’t need it
- **Assume compromise** — if a device is seized, treat it as compromised

Turning off a connection method does **not** delete messages or contacts.  
It only controls **which network paths Anonomi is allowed to use**.

title: Notifications
description: Control how and when Anonomi alerts you — without leaking unnecessary information.
---

Notifications are a tradeoff between **awareness** and **exposure**.

Anonomi lets you fine-tune which events generate notifications so you can stay informed without drawing attention or leaking metadata through your lock screen.

---

## Remind me to sign in

When enabled, Anonomi shows a reminder notification when the phone starts if you are not signed in.

This is useful if:
- You reboot your device frequently
- You rely on Anonomi for time-sensitive communication
- You want a prompt to restore connectivity after restart

Consider disabling this if:
- Notifications themselves create risk
- You prefer to control when the app becomes active

---

## Private messages

Configure alerts for **direct, one-to-one conversations**.

You can choose how private message notifications behave, including:
- Whether notifications are shown at all
- How visible they are on the lock screen (system-dependent)

In high-risk environments, consider:
- Minimizing notification detail
- Disabling previews at the system level

---

## Group messages

Configure alerts for **private group chats**.

Group activity can generate more frequent notifications than direct messages. Adjust these settings if:
- Notification volume becomes noticeable
- Group participation should remain low-profile

---

## Open group messages

Configure alerts for **public groups** (forums).

Public groups may have:
- Higher message volume
- Less predictable activity
- Wider membership

Many users choose to:
- Disable notifications entirely for open groups
- Check them manually instead

---

## Operational considerations

- Notifications can reveal **usage patterns**, even if message content is protected
- Lock screen visibility is controlled partly by the operating system
- Sounds, vibrations, and pop-ups may attract attention in sensitive environments

If notifications increase risk:
- Disable them selectively
- Or disable them entirely and check messages manually

---

## Practical guidance

- Enable only the notifications you truly need
- Prefer silent notifications over audible alerts
- Review your OS-level notification privacy settings
- Reassess notification settings when your environment changes

Notifications should serve *you*, not expose you.

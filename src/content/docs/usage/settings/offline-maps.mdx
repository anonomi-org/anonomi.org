title: Offline Maps
description: Download, import, and use maps without relying on live internet access.
---

Offline Maps let you view geographic data **without an active internet connection**.

This is useful when:
- Internet access is blocked or unreliable
- Using the network increases risk
- You want predictable, offline-only behavior

Anonomi does not fetch map tiles automatically. All map data must be **downloaded or transferred intentionally**.

---

## How offline maps work

Offline maps are stored locally on your device as map tile bundles.

Once imported:
- Maps are available without internet access
- No network requests are made while viewing maps
- Map usage does not reveal your location to external services

If no data is imported, the map view will remain empty.

## Onion URL for offline map data

Anonomi provides an **Onion service URL** where offline map data can be downloaded.

This URL:
- Is accessed over Tor
- Helps reduce metadata exposure while downloading map data
- Can be opened in Tor Browser or shared with another device

Tapping **“Copy Onion URL of Offline Maps Data Repository”** copies this address so you can:
- Open it later
- Share it securely
- Use it on a different device

You are not required to use this source — it is provided as a privacy-preserving option.

## Importing offline map data

Offline maps are imported from **ZIP files**.

To import map data:
1. Obtain a compatible offline map ZIP file
2. Open **Import Offline Map Data**
3. Select the ZIP file from your device storage
4. Wait for the import to complete

After import:
- The map appears in the Offline Maps list
- Multiple map regions can be imported
- Maps remain available until manually removed

---

## Managing imported maps

When map data is present:
- Imported regions are listed in this screen
- Each entry represents a locally stored map dataset

If no maps are present, the app will display:
> “No offline maps imported yet.”

Removing a map deletes it from local storage only.

---

## Security and privacy considerations

- Offline maps prevent live location lookups
- No background downloads occur
- No map usage telemetry is sent
- Imported data remains entirely local

However:
- Downloading large map files can still be observable at the network level
- Use Tor or trusted offline transfers when acquiring map data in high-risk environments

---

## When to use offline maps

Offline maps are recommended when:
- Navigating during internet shutdowns
- Coordinating movement without live connectivity
- You want predictable, zero-network behavior

Avoid relying on offline maps if:
- Map freshness is critical
- You cannot safely store large files on the device

description: Protect access to Anonomi, reduce exposure under coercion, and control how the app behaves in risky situations.
---

The **Security** settings control how Anonomi protects local access, reacts under pressure, and reduces harm if your device is inspected, seized, or coerced.

These options are not cosmetic. They are part of your operational security.

---

## App lock

App lock prevents Anonomi from being opened without unlocking your device.

When enabled:
- Anonomi requires your device’s screen lock (PIN, pattern, or password)
- The app cannot be used while locked

> App lock depends on your device security. If your device has no screen lock configured, this option will be unavailable.

### When to use it
- When others may have physical access to your device
- When you want a fast way to lock the app without signing out
- When your device may be inspected casually

---

## App lock inactivity timeout

You can configure Anonomi to **lock itself automatically** after a period of inactivity.

Example:
- Lock after 5 minutes of inactivity

This reduces risk when:
- You forget to lock the app manually
- You are interrupted or forced to hand over your device
- The app is left open unintentionally

---

## Change password

Anonomi uses a local password to protect your account state.

Changing your password:
- Updates the credentials required to access your account
- Does **not** notify contacts
- Does **not** recover lost accounts

> If you forget your password and lose access, recovery may not be possible. Plan accordingly.

---

## Panic button

Anonomi supports panic workflows via a companion panic-trigger app.

### Panic button setup

This setting defines how Anonomi reacts when a panic trigger is activated.

Possible behaviors may include:
- Deleting local account state
- Sending panic notifications to trusted contacts (when possible)
- Disabling future access

Exact behavior depends on:
- Your configuration
- Current connectivity (online vs offline)
- What actions are technically possible at the moment of triggering

> Panic actions are **best-effort**, not guaranteed. Design your workflow assuming limited time and degraded conditions.

## Stealth mode

Stealth mode disguises Anonomi to reduce suspicion during casual inspection.

When enabled:
- Anonomi appears as a calculator app in the app drawer
- The real app is hidden behind a secret unlock gesture or passcode

### Calculator passcode

You can set a passcode that unlocks the real app from the decoy calculator screen.

- The calculator remains functional
- Entering the correct passcode reveals Anonomi

This is designed to:
- Reduce attention during quick checks
- Avoid revealing the app’s true purpose

> Stealth mode is **misdirection**, not encryption. It helps against casual inspection, not determined forensic analysis.

## What these settings do *not* protect against

Security settings help reduce risk, but they are not magic.

They do **not** guarantee protection against:
- Advanced forensic extraction
- Malware on the device
- Coercion over time
- Legal compulsion

Use them as part of a broader operational strategy.

---

## Practical guidance

- Enable **app lock** if anyone else may touch your device
- Use **inactivity timeout** aggressively in high-risk environments
- Configure **panic behavior** before you need it
- Treat **stealth mode** as a delay tactic, not a shield
- Assume physical compromise is possible

Security is about *reducing harm*, not eliminating risk.

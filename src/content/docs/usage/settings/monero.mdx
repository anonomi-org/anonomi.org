title: Monero (XMR)
description: Configure Monero payment settings for payment requests and messaging.
---

Anonomi supports **Monero (XMR)** for private payment requests inside conversations.

Anonomi is **not a wallet**. These settings exist to generate payment requests, subaddresses, and QR codes — not to hold or spend funds.

---

## What Monero integration is (and is not)

Anonomi:
- Generates **Monero payment requests**
- Creates **unique subaddresses** per request
- Embeds payment details in messages and QR codes

Anonomi does **not**:
- Store funds
- Sign transactions
- Spend Monero on your behalf

All payments are handled by your wallet of choice.

---

## Primary Monero address

This is your **main Monero address**, used internally to derive subaddresses.

Important properties:
- The primary address is **not shared directly**
- Payment requests use **derived subaddresses**
- Contacts never see your primary address

This preserves privacy while allowing you to track incoming payments using your wallet.

---

## Private view key

The **private view key** allows Anonomi to:

- Derive subaddresses
- Detect incoming payments
- Associate payments with requests

It **cannot**:
- Spend funds
- Move funds
- Authorize transactions

This key is **read-only** by design. Even if exposed, it does not allow theft — only blockchain observation.

You should still treat it as sensitive metadata.

---

## Monero rate (manual)

Anonomi does not rely on external servers.

Because of this:
- Exchange rates are **not fetched automatically**
- You must **set the Monero ↔ fiat rate manually**

This rate is used when:
- Creating payment requests
- Generating QR codes
- Sending payment messages to contacts

The selected fiat currency and rate are **embedded in the request**, ensuring both sides see the same value.

---

## Subaddress index

Each payment request uses a **new subaddress**.

The subaddress index controls:
- Which subaddress is generated next
- How requests are separated and tracked

You can:
- Reset the index
- Manually set a specific index

This is useful if:
- Restoring from backup
- Reconciling addresses with an external wallet
- Re-aligning after importing keys elsewhere

---

## Privacy considerations

Monero integration in Anonomi is designed to minimize leakage:

- No address reuse
- No server-side rate tracking
- No wallet custody
- No transaction signing

Your wallet remains the only place funds exist.

---

## When to use Monero features

Use Monero integration if:
- You want private payment requests
- You already use a Monero wallet
- You want payment metadata kept inside encrypted messages

Avoid it if:
- Cryptocurrency usage increases risk in your environment
- You cannot safely manage wallet keys

Monero features are optional.

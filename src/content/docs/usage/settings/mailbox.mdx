title: Anonomi Postbox
description: Receive and send messages while offline using a linked Mailbox device.
---

Anonomi Postbox is a companion app that allows you to **receive and send messages even when your main Anonomi device is offline**.

From the Settings screen, you can configure and manage how Mailbox is used with your account.

## What is a Mailbox?

A Mailbox is a **separate Anonomi Postbox app** installed on another Android device.

Its role is simple:

- Receive encrypted messages from your contacts while you are offline
- Store those messages securely
- Deliver them automatically when your main device comes online again

Likewise, messages you send while your contacts are offline can be delivered through their Mailboxes when they reconnect.

The Mailbox **cannot read messages** and does not act as a traditional server.

## Why use a Mailbox?

Mailbox is useful when:

- Your phone is often offline
- You intentionally keep your main device disconnected
- You want asynchronous communication without constant connectivity

Typical setups include:
- A spare Android phone
- A device left at home
- A device kept powered and connected to Wi-Fi

---

## How Mailbox works (high level)

1. You install the **Anonomi Postbox app** on a separate device
2. You link it to your Anonomi account by scanning a QR code
3. The Mailbox stays online and receives encrypted messages on your behalf
4. When your main device comes online, it fetches messages automatically

All communication remains end-to-end encrypted.

## Mailbox in Settings

From **Settings → Anonomi Postbox**, you can:

- Set up a new Mailbox
- Link or unlink a Mailbox device
- View Mailbox status
- Disable Mailbox usage entirely

Mailbox behavior depends on your **Connections** settings — internet access uses Tor when enabled.

## Security considerations

Using a Mailbox changes your threat model slightly:

- The Mailbox device is a **separate point of exposure**
- If seized, it may reveal:
  - That you use Anonomi
  - That a Mailbox is linked to your account
- It does **not** reveal message contents

Best practices:
- Use a dedicated device
- Keep it physically secure
- Keep it updated
- Do not log into your main Anonomi app on the Mailbox device

If Mailbox increases risk in your environment, do not use it — Anonomi works without it.

---

## When *not* to use Mailbox

Avoid using Mailbox if:

- You expect device seizures
- You cannot physically secure the Mailbox device
- Being continuously reachable increases risk
- Offline-only workflows are safer for you

Mailbox is optional by design.

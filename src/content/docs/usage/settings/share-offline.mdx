title: Share this app offline
description: Share Anonomi with nearby devices without using the internet.
---

The **Share this app offline** feature lets you share Anonomi with someone nearby **without any internet connection**.

This is useful when:
- App stores are blocked or unsafe
- Internet access is unavailable or risky
- You want to install Anonomi on another device discreetly

---

## How it works

When you start offline sharing:

1. Your phone temporarily creates a **local Wi-Fi hotspot**
2. An internal web server runs on your device
3. Nearby devices connect to your hotspot
4. They download the Anonomi app **directly from your phone**

No external network traffic is involved.

---

## What is shared

Depending on your configuration, the offline share can include:
- The Anonomi app
- Additional companion apps (if available on your device)

Everything is served locally from your phone.

## Starting offline sharing

To share the app:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Tap **Share this app offline**
3. Tap **Start hotspot**
4. Ask the other person to:
   - Join the Wi-Fi network shown on your screen
   - Open the local page in their browser
   - Download and install the app

Once finished, stop the hotspot to end sharing.

## Security and privacy notes

- No internet connection is required
- No data is sent to external servers
- Devices must be physically nearby
- Anyone who joins the hotspot can access the shared files

**Important:**  
Only use this feature around people you trust, and stop sharing as soon as installation is complete.

## When to use offline sharing

Offline sharing is recommended when:
- You’re in a censored or high-risk network environment
- Installing from app stores would create exposure
- You want to distribute Anonomi discreetly

Avoid using it in crowded or uncontrolled spaces.

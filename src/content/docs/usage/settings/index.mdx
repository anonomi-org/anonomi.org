description: Configure Anonomi for your environment, threat level, and operational needs.
---

Anonomi settings are not cosmetic preferences.  
They control **how visible you are**, **how the app behaves under pressure**, and **what happens when things go wrong**.

Before using Anonomi in a real situation, you should understand what each settings category does — and when it matters.

---

## How to think about settings

Most apps assume:
- Stable internet
- Trusted devices
- No physical access by adversaries

Anonomi assumes the opposite.

Settings exist to help you:
- Reduce metadata exposure
- Control network behavior
- Limit damage if your device is seized
- Adapt to different risk environments

You don’t need to enable everything.  
You need to enable **what matches your situation**.

## Settings categories

### Display
Control how the app looks and behaves visually.

- Language & region
- Theme (light / dark / system)

These settings don’t affect security directly, but they matter for usability under stress.

→ [Display settings](/docs/usage/settings/display)

---

### Connections
Control **when and how** Anonomi uses the network.

This includes:
- Tor connectivity
- Bridge usage
- Internet vs offline operation
- Battery and data constraints

This is one of the most important areas to review before high-risk use.

→ [Connections](/docs/usage/settings/connections)

---

### Security
Controls what happens when **someone else touches your device**.

This includes:
- App lock
- Password changes
- Panic button
- Stealth mode

If you expect device inspection, coercion, or confiscation, review these first.

→ [Security settings](/docs/usage/settings/security)

---

### Notifications
Controls what Anonomi reveals **outside the app**.

Notifications can leak:
- Who you’re talking to
- When messages arrive
- Whether the app is in use

Adjust these carefully depending on your environment.

→ [Notification settings](/docs/usage/settings/notifications)

---

### Feature-specific settings

Some features have their own configuration pages:

- **Anonomi Postbox**
  → [Postbox settings](/docs/usage/settings/postbox)

- **Monero payments**  
  → [Monero settings](/docs/usage/settings/monero)

- **Offline maps**  
  → [Offline maps settings](/docs/usage/settings/offline-maps)

These settings only appear if you use the feature.

---

## When to review settings

You should review settings:

- **After installation**
- **Before entering a high-risk environment**
- **When changing countries or networks**
- **After a device update**
- **After adding new contacts**

Settings are part of your operational posture — not a one-time setup.

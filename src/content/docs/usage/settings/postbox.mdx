title: Anonomi Postbox
description: Receive and send messages while offline using a linked Postbox device.
---

Anonomi Postbox is a companion app that allows you to **receive and send messages even when your main Anonomi device is offline**.

From the Settings screen, you can configure and manage how Postbox is used with your account.

## What is a Postbox?

A Postbox is a **separate Anonomi Postbox app** installed on another Android device.

Its role is simple:

- Receive encrypted messages from your contacts while you are offline
- Store those messages securely
- Deliver them automatically when your main device comes online again

Likewise, messages you send while your contacts are offline can be delivered through their Postboxes when they reconnect.

The Postbox **cannot read messages** and does not act as a traditional server.

## Why use a Postbox?

Postbox is useful when:

- Your phone is often offline
- You intentionally keep your main device disconnected
- You want asynchronous communication without constant connectivity

Typical setups include:
- A spare Android phone
- A device left at home
- A device kept powered and connected to Wi-Fi

---

## How Postbox works (high level)

1. You install the **Anonomi Postbox app** on a separate device
2. You link it to your Anonomi account by scanning a QR code
3. The Postbox stays online and receives encrypted messages on your behalf
4. When your main device comes online, it fetches messages automatically

All communication remains end-to-end encrypted.

## Postbox in Settings

From **Settings → Anonomi Postbox**, you can:

- Set up a new Postbox
- Link or unlink a Postbox device
- View Postbox status
- Disable Postbox usage entirely

Postbox behavior depends on your **Connections** settings — internet access uses Tor when enabled.

## Security considerations

Using a Postbox changes your threat model slightly:

- The Postbox device is a **separate point of exposure**
- If seized, it may reveal:
  - That you use Anonomi
  - That a Postbox is linked to your account
- It does **not** reveal message contents

Best practices:
- Use a dedicated device
- Keep it physically secure
- Keep it updated
- Do not log into your main Anonomi app on the Postbox device

If Postbox increases risk in your environment, do not use it — Anonomi works without it.

---

## When *not* to use Postbox

Avoid using Postbox if:

- You expect device seizures
- You cannot physically secure the Postbox device
- Being continuously reachable increases risk
- Offline-only workflows are safer for you

Postbox is optional by design.

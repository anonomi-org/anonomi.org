title: Creating an account
description: Create your Anonomi account and understand what it means to be device-bound.
---

Creating an Anonomi account is intentionally different from creating an account on a typical messaging app.

There are no usernames, no phone numbers, no email addresses, and no central server holding your identity.

Your account **exists only on your device**.

---

## What an “account” means in Anonomi

An Anonomi account is:
- A cryptographic identity generated locally on your device
- Not registered with any server
- Not recoverable by the project or anyone else

This design removes centralized control and account takeovers — but it also means **you are responsible for your account**.

---

## Creating your account

When you first open Anonomi, you’ll be prompted to create an account.

### Step 1 — Choose a display name
This is the name shown to your contacts.

- It does **not** have to be unique
- It can be changed later
- It is not used as an identifier on the network

Choose something that makes sense for the context you’re operating in.

### Step 2 — Confirm account creation
Once confirmed:
- Your cryptographic identity is generated
- Your account is stored locally on the device
- You’re ready to add contacts

No network connection is required to create an account.

---

## Important limitations (read this carefully)

### No password recovery
Anonomi cannot reset or recover your account.

If you:
- Lose your device
- Delete app data
- Uninstall the app without a backup

…your account and contacts are permanently lost.

This is not a bug — it’s a consequence of avoiding centralized control.

### One account per device
Each installation creates its own identity.

Installing Anonomi on a second device creates a **new, separate account**, even if you use the same display name.

---

## Backups (if supported on your device)

If backup features are available on your platform version:

- Backups should be stored securely
- Treat them like keys, not like chat history
- Anyone with access to a backup may be able to impersonate you

If you’re operating in a high-risk environment, **not backing up may be safer** than backing up insecurely.

---

## Before adding contacts

Before you start connecting with others:
- Understand how contact verification works
- Decide how cautious you need to be
- Read the operational guidance if your situation involves real risk

## Summary

- Anonomi accounts are device-bound and decentralized
- There is no central authority that can recover or reset your account
- Security comes from eliminating dependencies — not from convenience features

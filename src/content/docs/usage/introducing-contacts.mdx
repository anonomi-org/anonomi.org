title: Introducing contacts
description: Safely introduce two of your contacts to each other without requiring them to meet.
---

Anonomi allows you to **introduce two of your existing contacts to each other**.

This lets them become contacts **without meeting in person** and without exposing their contact links publicly. Introductions are **opt-in on both sides** and do not bypass consent or verification.

---

## What is an introduction?

An introduction is a **mediated contact request**.

Instead of exchanging contact links directly, you act as a trusted bridge:
- You already know both people
- You ask Anonomi to introduce them
- Each person independently decides whether to accept

If both accept, they become contacts with each other.

If either declines, nothing happens.

---

## When introductions make sense

Introductions are useful when:
- Two trusted contacts should know each other
- Meeting in person is not possible
- Exchanging links directly would be risky or inconvenient
- You want to reduce exposure of contact links

Introductions **do not replace verification** — they simply reduce friction.

---

## Starting an introduction

### Step 1 — Open a contact
1. Go to **Contacts**
2. Tap the name of the contact you want to start from
3. Open the contact menu
4. Select **Make introduction**

---

### Step 2 — Choose the second contact
You’ll be shown your contact list.

Select the **other contact** you want to introduce.

---

### Step 3 — Add an optional message
You can include a short message explaining:
- Who the other person is
- Why you think the introduction makes sense
- Any context that helps them decide

This message is optional but recommended.

Tap **Make introduction** to send the request.

---

## What your contacts see

Each contact receives an **introduction request** that includes:
- The name you use for the other person
- Your optional message
- A clear choice to **accept** or **decline**

They do **not** automatically become contacts.

---

## Accepting or declining an introduction

- If **both contacts accept**, Anonomi securely connects them and adds them to each other’s contact lists.
- If **either contact declines**, the introduction is cancelled.
- Declining does **not** notify the other person of who declined.

No contact is added unless **both parties explicitly agree**.

---

## Security and trust notes

- Introductions do **not** grant access to message history
- You cannot see messages exchanged after an introduction
- You cannot force or observe acceptance
- Introductions do not weaken existing contacts

You are responsible for **who you vouch for**.

---

## Verification still matters

Even with an introduction:
- Contacts should verify each other’s identities
- High-risk environments require extra caution
- Out-of-band verification is still recommended

Trust should never be assumed automatically.

---

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Introducing people you don’t fully trust
- Treating introductions as identity verification
- Introducing contacts under pressure or coercion
- Repeatedly re-sending declined introductions

Anonomi makes introductions possible — not mandatory.

---

## Summary

- Introductions connect two existing contacts
- Both parties must explicitly accept
- Optional context improves safety
- No central authority is involved

title: Adding contacts
description: How to add contacts in Anonomi — nearby or at a distance, without central servers.
---

Adding contacts in Anonomi is a deliberate, manual process.

There is no global directory, no username search, and no automatic discovery.  
Contacts are added **person-to-person**, using cryptographic links that you exchange intentionally.

This section explains the two supported ways to add contacts and what to expect in each case.

---

## The two ways to add a contact

Anonomi supports **two distinct contact flows**, depending on whether you can meet the person or not:

1. **Add contact nearby** (in person — strongest verification)
2. **Add contact at a distance** (remote exchange — requires care)

Both methods require **mutual consent**. You cannot message someone unless both sides complete the process.

## Add contact nearby (recommended)

This is the safest way to add a contact.

You and the other person meet in person and scan each other’s QR codes.  
This ensures you are connecting to the **exact device in front of you**, preventing impersonation.

### Step-by-step

1. Open **Contacts**
2. Tap **Add contact nearby**
3. When prompted, tap **Continue**
4. Scan the QR code shown on your contact’s screen
5. Ask your contact to scan **your** QR code

After both scans:
- The devices exchange cryptographic information
- The contact is added to both contact lists
- You are ready to communicate securely

No internet connection is required.

## Add contact at a distance

Use this method when you cannot meet in person.

This involves exchanging a **contact link** through a channel you choose.

### Step-by-step

1. Open **Contacts**
2. Tap **Add contact at a distance**
3. Copy your contact link (or use the Share option)
4. Send the link to the person you want to add
5. Receive their contact link
6. Paste their link into the field and continue
7. Choose a nickname for the contact

Once completed, the contact will appear as **pending**.

---

## Pending contact requests

When adding a contact at a distance, Anonomi must establish a secure connection before the contact becomes active.

While this is happening:
- The contact appears in **Pending contacts**
- Anonomi will periodically try to connect
- No messages can be exchanged yet

Once a connection succeeds:
- Both of you are added to each other’s contact lists
- Secure communication becomes available

---

## If adding a contact fails

If Anonomi cannot establish a connection after an extended period (for example, due to network issues or incorrect links), the pending contact may fail.

If this happens:
1. Both parties should delete the pending contact
2. Exchange new contact links
3. Try again

Failed requests do not compromise existing contacts.

---

## Verification still matters

Adding a contact — especially at a distance — does **not automatically verify identity**.

In higher-risk situations:
- Verify contact details using a second channel
- Confirm identities verbally or in writing
- Prefer in-person QR exchange whenever possible

If something feels wrong, do not proceed.

---

## Removing a contact

You can remove a contact at any time.

Removing a contact:
- Deletes the local association
- Prevents further communication
- Does **not** notify the other person

If you suspect compromise, remove the contact immediately.

---

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Adding contacts from public posts or unknown sources
- Sharing contact links in public channels
- Skipping verification in high-risk environments
- Assuming a nickname equals a known identity

Anonomi removes central points of failure — it does not remove the need for caution.

---

## Summary

- Contacts are added manually, by design
- Nearby contact exchange provides the strongest verification
- Distance contact exchange requires careful link handling
- Mutual consent is required to communicate

description: Why Anonomi exists, and what it refuses to become.
---

## This is not about convenience

Power is centralizing.

What used to be fragmented — communication, identity, movement, memory — is being consolidated into systems built for observation, correlation, and control. Surveillance is no longer an exceptional response to crisis. It is **default infrastructure**.

Corporations normalize it to extract profit.  
States normalize it to enforce compliance.  
Platforms normalize it as “user experience.”

The outcome is always the same:

**Metadata becomes destiny.**

You don’t need to read messages to understand a person.  
Who they talk to. When. Where. How often. For how long.  
That is usually enough.

---

## Surveillance is not a bug — it is the business model

Anonomi begins from a simple, uncomfortable assumption:

> **Assume the network is hostile.**

Assume traffic is monitored.  
Assume filtering, throttling, and manipulation are invisible.  
Assume devices are inspected.  
Assume contacts can be pressured, coerced, or compromised over time.

This is not paranoia.  
This is how modern communication systems are designed.

If your safety, freedom, or ability to dissent depends on secrecy, relying on benevolent platforms or “best effort” privacy is not a strategy — it is a gamble.

---

## Anti-fascist by design

Authoritarian systems depend on:
- Centralization
- Surveillance
- Infrastructure capture
- Fear of communication

Anonomi is engineered to remove those levers.

There are:
- No centralized servers to seize
- No global directories to subpoena
- No accounts to coerce
- No identity layer that can be flipped into a control mechanism

The system is intentionally **incompatible with authoritarian control**.

This is not accidental.  
This is not neutral.

---

## No servers to seize, no accounts to own

Anonomi rejects the server-centric model entirely.

There is no global backend to shut down, infiltrate, or quietly modify.  
There is no phone number identity.  
No email-based recovery.  
No centralized authority that can be pressured “just this once”.

Communication happens directly between peers, using whatever transport is safest under current conditions.

When the internet is usable, route through Tor.  
When the internet is dangerous, avoid it.  
When networks fail, keep communicating anyway.

---

## Offline is not a fallback — it is a strategy

Connectivity is fragile.  
Dependence on it is a liability.

Anonomi is designed to function:
- **Online**, over Tor
- **Offline**, over local Wi-Fi
- **Offline**, over Bluetooth
- **Offline**, via store-and-forward and physical transfer

This is not nostalgia.  
It is adaptation to reality.

In protests, blackouts, border crossings, sieges, and high-risk travel, the safest network is often **no network at all**.

---

## Metadata is the real battlefield

End-to-end encryption is necessary — and insufficient.

Most harm today does not come from leaked content, but from leaked context:
- Persistent identifiers
- Centralized timestamps
- Correlatable infrastructure
- Reused addresses and patterns

Anonomi treats metadata reduction as a **first-class design constraint**, not a marketing checkbox.

Privacy is not one feature.  
It is an ecosystem of deliberate decisions.

---

## Safety includes coercion scenarios

Threat models that ignore coercion are fantasies.

People are detained.  
Phones are searched.  
Passcodes are demanded.  
Sometimes the adversary is not remote — they are standing in front of you.

Anonomi accounts for this reality with:
- Stealth modes that obscure intent
- Panic workflows that reduce damage under pressure
- Optional signaling to trusted contacts when things go wrong

These are not edge cases.  
For many users, they are the baseline.

---

## This tool is not neutral

Anonomi does not pretend to serve everyone equally.

It is built for people who:
- Cannot rely on institutional protection
- Cannot afford metadata exposure
- Cannot assume good faith from networks or platforms
- Need tools that keep working when conditions deteriorate

This includes journalists, organizers, whistleblowers —  
and ordinary people living under extraordinary pressure.

---

## No promises of perfect anonymity

Anonomi does not promise invisibility.

No software can protect against compromised devices, unsafe behavior, or adversaries with physical control. Anyone claiming otherwise is lying — or selling something.

What Anonomi offers instead is **resilience**:
- Fewer single points of failure
- Fewer assumptions about trust
- More ways to adapt when systems are captured or broken

---

## This is about freedom of action

At its core, Anonomi exists to give people back control.

Control over how they communicate.
Control over when they disconnect.
Control over what they reveal — and what they do not.

Privacy is not secrecy for its own sake.
It is the freedom to think, speak, and organize without being watched.

Anonomi exists to protect that freedom —  
**without asking for permission.**

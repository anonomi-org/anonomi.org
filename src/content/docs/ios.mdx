title: Why Anonomi Messenger will not support iOS
description: Platform constraints that make iOS incompatible with Anonomi Messenger’s threat model.
---

Anonomi Messenger is **intentionally Android-only**.

This is not a matter of preference, resources, or popularity.  
It is a **design decision driven by the threat model** Anonomi Messenger is built for.

This page explains why an iOS version would require compromises the project is not willing to make.

---

## Anonomi Messenger’s threat model comes first

Anonomi Messenger is designed for environments where:

- Networks may be monitored or blocked
- Internet access may be dangerous
- Devices may be inspected or seized
- Users may need to operate fully offline
- Centralized infrastructure is a liability

Every platform decision is evaluated against these assumptions.

---

## iOS imposes architectural constraints

iOS enforces platform-level restrictions that conflict with Anonomi Messenger’s core guarantees.

### 1. Restricted networking control

Anonomi Messenger requires:
- Fine-grained control over network routing
- Offline transports (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, store-and-forward)
- Predictable background behavior

On iOS:
- Network traffic is heavily mediated by the OS
- Background execution is tightly limited
- Long-lived or unconventional networking patterns are discouraged or blocked

These restrictions make reliable offline and Tor-based workflows fragile or impossible.

---

### 2. App Store control and distribution limits

Anonomi Messenger is designed to:
- Be installable outside app stores
- Support offline, device-to-device distribution
- Avoid account-linked distribution pipelines

On iOS:
- App Store distribution is effectively mandatory
- Sideloading is restricted, fragile, or region-dependent
- Offline app sharing workflows are not realistically possible

This creates dependency on centralized infrastructure that Anonomi Messenger explicitly avoids.

---

### 3. Background operation and persistence

Anonomi Messenger relies on:
- Predictable background behavior
- Local message handling without constant foreground use
- Optional helper components (e.g., Postbox)

On iOS:
- Background execution is aggressively limited
- Apps are suspended or terminated without notice
- Persistent communication workflows cannot be relied upon

These constraints undermine reliability in high-risk scenarios.

---

### 4. Stealth and coercion-resistance limitations

Anonomi Messenger includes features intended to reduce harm under coercion:
- Stealth modes
- Panic workflows
- Minimal OS visibility

iOS severely limits:
- App disguise capabilities
- Control over system-level visibility
- Meaningful stealth under inspection

Supporting iOS would mean advertising protections that cannot actually be delivered.

---

## Why not “a limited iOS version”?

A reduced iOS version would:
- Remove offline guarantees
- Depend on centralized distribution
- Restrict background behavior
- Offer weaker safety properties

This would create **false confidence**, which is worse than no support at all.

Anonomi Messenger prefers honesty over reach.

---

## This is not an anti-iOS stance

This decision is not about:
- Market share
- Developer convenience
- Platform popularity

It is about **not shipping a tool that fails when people rely on it most**.

---

## What if iOS changes?

If iOS were to:
- Allow real offline distribution
- Offer meaningful background networking control
- Reduce mandatory platform mediation

Then the decision could be revisited.

Until then, supporting iOS would mean compromising guarantees Anonomi Messenger is not willing to weaken.

---

## Summary

Anonomi Messenger is Android-only because:

- Offline-first communication is non-negotiable
- Centralized app store dependency is a risk
- Background networking control matters
- Stealth and coercion resistance require platform freedom

Supporting iOS would require trading safety for availability.

That trade is not acceptable.

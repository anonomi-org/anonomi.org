title: Support Anonomi
description: Help keep Anonomi independent, resilient, and available to those who need it most.
---

Anonomi is built for people operating under pressure — not for growth metrics, venture capital, or institutional control.

Supporting the project means helping keep it **independent**, **maintainable**, and **available in hostile environments**.

There are several ways to help, depending on what you can offer.

---

## What support means here

Anonomi is:
- Free and open source
- Built without centralized servers
- Designed for high-risk and adversarial environments

That also means:
- Infrastructure costs are real
- Maintenance work is ongoing
- Independence must be actively protected

> **Sponsorship does not equal influence.  
Anonomi is governed by its community — not sponsors, not donors, not institutions.**

---

## Financial support

Financial contributions help cover:
- Build and release infrastructure
- Signing and distribution costs
- Long-term maintenance
- Keeping the project independent of surveillance-driven platforms

Financial support **also helps sustain our contribution to the Tor network**, including running relays and bridges that improve network resilience for everyone — not just Anonomi users.

### Important principles

- Donations do **not** buy influence
- No feature prioritization for donors
- No access privileges
- No roadmap control

Support keeps the lights on — it does not steer the project.

> Details on accepted methods (including privacy-respecting options) are published separately.

## Technical contributions

If you have technical skills, this is one of the most valuable ways to help.

You can contribute by:
- Reviewing code
- Improving documentation
- Testing releases in different environments
- Reporting bugs clearly and responsibly
- Helping with reproducible builds

See:
- **[Contributing](/docs/contributing)**

---

## Infrastructure support

Anonomi depends on a wider ecosystem.

Ways to help:
- Running Tor relays or bridges
- Map Tiles repository
- Helping test offline distribution workflows
- Providing feedback from real-world deployments

Even small infrastructure contributions improve resilience.

---

## Community support

Not all support is technical.

You can help by:
- Helping others understand threat models and limitations
- Translating documentation
- Sharing safe usage practices
- Correcting misinformation

The goal is not mass adoption — it’s **informed use**.

---

## What we will not do

To be explicit, Anonomi will not:
- Accept funding that requires control or oversight
- Add telemetry or tracking
- Centralize infrastructure “for convenience”
- Trade privacy for reach

If that ever changes, the project has failed its own principles.

---

## Transparency

Major decisions, tradeoffs, and limitations are documented openly.

If something is unsafe, incomplete, or experimental, it is described as such — not hidden behind marketing language.

---

## In short

If you value:
- Tools that work offline
- Resistance to surveillance and coercion
- Software that assumes hostile environments

Then supporting Anonomi helps keep those options available.

Thank you for standing with a project that prioritizes **safety over scale**.

This FAQ answers common questions about Anonomi Messenger’s design, capabilities, and limitations.

If you’re new, also read:
- **[Threat model](/docs/security/threat-model)**
- **[Operational security basics](/docs/usage/opsec)**

---

## Is Anonomi Messenger anonymous?

Anonomi Messenger is designed to **reduce metadata exposure**, not to provide magical or absolute anonymity.

What it does:
- Avoids centralized servers
- Routes internet traffic over Tor
- Supports fully offline communication
- Minimizes unnecessary identifiers

What it cannot do:
- Protect you from a compromised device
- Fix unsafe behavior
- Make you anonymous if you reveal your identity through actions or content

Anonomi Messenger is a tool — how safely it’s used matters.

---

## Does Anonomi Messenger use servers?

No central servers.

Communication happens:
- Directly between devices (offline modes)
- Over Tor for internet-based communication
- Via optional helper components (e.g., Mailbox) that **do not act as message-reading servers**

There is no central infrastructure to subpoena, seize, or log conversations.

---

## Why is Anonomi Messenger Android-only?

Anonomi Messenger relies on:
- Low-level networking control
- Offline transports
- Background operation without platform mediation
- Distribution outside centralized app stores

Current iOS platform constraints make these guarantees impossible without compromise.

See:
- **[Why Anonomi Messenger does not support iOS](/docs/ios)** (if/when you publish it)

---

## Can I use Anonomi Messenger without the internet?

Yes.

Anonomi Messenger supports:
- **Wi-Fi (local network)**
- **Bluetooth (proximity)**
- **External storage / store-and-forward**
- **Offline app distribution**

In some environments, staying offline is safer than trying to connect.

See:
- **[Online + Offline connectivity](/docs/features/connectivity)**
- **[Scenarios and tradeoffs](/docs/usage/scenarios)**

---

## What happens if my device is seized?

Assume the device is compromised.

Anonomi Messenger helps reduce exposure, but:
- It cannot protect messages already stored on the device
- It cannot protect against coercion or forced unlocks
- It cannot remotely “save” a seized device

Use:
- **App lock**
- **Stealth mode**
- **Panic workflows**
- **Good OPSEC habits**

See:
- **[Security settings](/docs/usage/settings/security)**
- **[Operational security basics](/docs/usage/opsec)**

---

## What is the Panic Button, really?

The panic workflow is a **risk-reduction tool**, not a guarantee.

Depending on configuration and situation, triggering panic may:
- Delete local app state
- Lock or hide the app
- Send a panic message to designated contacts (when possible)

It does **not**:
- Guarantee data destruction on seized hardware
- Override OS-level or hardware-level forensics
- Protect against ongoing coercion

See:
- **[Panic button + panic contacts](/docs/features/panic)**

---

## Can group chats leak more information?

Groups increase exposure by nature:
- More participants
- More devices
- More opportunities for compromise

Private groups are safer than public groups, but:
- Any member can leak content
- Metadata risk grows with group size

Keep groups:
- Small
- Purpose-driven
- Short-lived when possible

---

## Are voice messages safe?

Voice messages carry **biometric risk**.

Anonomi Messenger offers optional **voice distortion** to reduce voice identification risk, but:
- Distortion is not a guarantee
- Voice content itself may reveal identity
- Background sounds can be identifying

Use voice messages only when appropriate.

See:
- **[Voice messages + distortion](/docs/features/voice)**

---

## How private are Monero payment requests?

Anonomi Messenger:
- Uses Monero primitives designed for privacy
- Generates unique subaddresses per request
- Avoids centralized payment servers

However:
- Payment privacy depends on wallet hygiene
- Amounts and timing may still leak information
- Fiat conversions require user-supplied rates

See:
- **[Monero settings](/docs/usage/settings/monero)**

---

## Can I recover my account if I lose my device?

No.

Anonomi Messenger does not rely on central accounts or recovery servers.

If you lose your device or delete the app:
- Your account and keys may be permanently lost
- Your contacts may not be recoverable

This is a tradeoff for decentralization.

---

## Is Anonomi Messenger legal?

That depends on your jurisdiction.

Anonomi Messenger is a communication tool. However:
- Use of Tor may be restricted in some regions
- Encryption laws vary
- Offline distribution may raise suspicion in some environments

Know your local risks before use.

---

## Where should I start if I’m unsure?

Start here:
1. **[Threat model](/docs/security/threat-model)**
2. **[Operational security basics](/docs/usage/opsec)**
3. **[Scenarios and tradeoffs](/docs/usage/scenarios)**

Anonomi Messenger works best when you understand *why* you’re using a feature — not just *how*.

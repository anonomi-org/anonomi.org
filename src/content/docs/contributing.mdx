description: How to contribute to Anonomi safely and responsibly.
---

Anonomi is open source and community-driven. Contributions are welcome — **with care for security, privacy, and users operating under risk**.

## Ways to contribute

### Code
- Bug fixes
- Security hardening
- UX improvements that do not weaken anonymity
- Documentation improvements

Before submitting code:
- Prefer small, focused changes
- Avoid adding dependencies unless strictly necessary
- Assume contributors and users may operate under adversarial conditions

### Documentation
Docs are as important as code. You can help by:
- Clarifying setup steps
- Improving threat model explanations
- Fixing inaccuracies or outdated info

### Security research
If you find a security issue:
- **Do not open a public issue**
- Follow responsible disclosure (see below)

---

## Repository structure
Anonomi consists of multiple components (apps, services, docs).  
Refer to the relevant repository before submitting changes.

Documentation changes should be made in the website repository.

---

## Submitting changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a dedicated branch
3. Make your changes
4. Open a pull request with:
   - Clear description
   - Rationale (why this change matters)
   - Security impact (if any)

Avoid squashing unrelated changes into one PR.

---

## Responsible disclosure

If you discover a security or privacy vulnerability:
- Do **not** disclose it publicly
- Do **not** open a GitHub issue

Instead:
- Contact the maintainers via email: **hello@anonomi.com**
- Provide enough detail to reproduce the issue safely

We aim to acknowledge and fix issues responsibly.

## Philosophy

Anonomi prioritizes:
- Minimal metadata
- User safety over convenience
- Transparency over growth
- Forkability over control

If your contribution aligns with these principles, it is welcome.

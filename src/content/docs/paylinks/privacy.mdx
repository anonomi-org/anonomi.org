title: Paylinks Privacy
description: How Anonomi Paylinks protects publisher and donor privacy.
---

Anonomi Paylinks is designed with privacy as a core principle, not an afterthought. This document explains what data we handle, how we handle it, and what guarantees we can (and cannot) make.

---

## Publisher privacy

### What we store

When you create a Paylink, we store:
- Your **Monero primary address** (public)
- Your **private view key** (encrypted at rest)
- Configuration options (label, index range, generation mode)
- A derived **owner key** (hash) for authentication

### What we don't store

- Your **spend key** — never requested, never stored
- Your identity — no accounts, no emails, no phone numbers
- IP addresses or access logs tied to paylinks

### The view key

Your private view key allows us to derive subaddresses but **cannot be used to spend funds**. It is:
- Encrypted before storage
- Used only during subaddress generation
- Never exposed in API responses

---

## Donor privacy

### What we collect

**Nothing.**

When a donor generates a payment request:
- No IP address is logged
- No amount is stored
- No description is saved
- No timestamp is recorded

The payment details exist only in the donor's browser during the session.

### Network considerations

Donors should be aware:
- **Clearnet**: Requests go through standard HTTPS. Your ISP can see you visited anonomi.org (but not the content).
- **Tor**: Use the onion service for stronger anonymity. Exit nodes don't apply since it's a hidden service.

For maximum privacy, donors should:
- Use Tor Browser
- Access the onion version of Paylinks
- Use a privacy-respecting Monero wallet

---

## Subaddress generation

### How it works

Monero subaddresses are derived deterministically from:
- The primary address
- The private view key
- An index number

This means:
- The server can generate receiving addresses
- The server **cannot** spend received funds
- Each subaddress is unlinkable to others (on-chain)

### Generation modes

**Random** (default): A random index within a configured range is selected for each request. This provides good privacy with minimal configuration.

**Sequential** (coming soon): Indices are assigned in order. Useful for tracking donations but reduces privacy.

## What we can't protect against

### Blockchain analysis

Once a payment is made, standard Monero privacy applies. Monero provides strong on-chain privacy by default.

**Donor isolation**: Each donor receives a distinct subaddress. If one donor is coerced into revealing their transaction, they cannot expose other donors — they only know the address they sent to, not the addresses given to others. This is particularly important for groups (e.g., supporters of a cause) where one compromised individual should not endanger the rest.

**Subaddress reuse**: If the same subaddress is given to multiple donors (e.g., due to a narrow index range), payments to that address could be correlated. Use a sufficiently wide index range to minimize this risk.

### Device compromise

If the donor's device is compromised, the payment address and amount may be exposed regardless of Paylinks privacy measures.

### Publisher OPSEC failures

If a publisher exposes their own identity through other means (blog content, social media, etc.), Paylinks cannot retroactively protect that.

## Comparison with alternatives

| Method | Address reuse | View key exposure | Metadata logging |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Static donation address | Every payment | N/A | Depends on platform |
| Paylinks | Fresh per request | Server only (encrypted) | None |
| Messenger Payment Requests | Fresh per request | Never leaves device | None |

---

## Technical details

### API endpoints

The Paylinks API is available at:
- **Clearnet**: `https://paylinksd.anonomi.org`
- **Onion**: `http://[onion-address].onion`

### Data retention

- Paylinks can be deleted by the publisher at any time
- No payment metadata is retained
- Deleted paylinks are permanently removed

### Open source

Both the client (this website) and the API are open source:
- Website: [anonomi.org repository](https://github.com/anonomi-org/anonomi.org)
- API: Available in the Anonomi organization

|--------|-----------|
| Spend key | Never requested |
| View key | Encrypted at rest |
| Donor IP | Not logged |
| Payment amounts | Not stored |
| Payment descriptions | Not stored |
| Subaddresses | Fresh per request |

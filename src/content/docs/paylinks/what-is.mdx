title: What is Anonomi Paylinks?
description: Private donation buttons for publishers without exposing long-lived wallet addresses.
---

Anonomi Paylinks lets publishers embed a **Donate button** on their website or blog without exposing a long-lived wallet address.

Each time a donor clicks the button, a **fresh subaddress** is generated — reducing the risk of address correlation and surveillance.

---

## Who is it for?

Paylinks is designed for **publishers under pressure**:
- Journalists
- Bloggers
- Activists
- Content creators in hostile environments

Anyone who needs to receive donations privately, without exposing a static wallet address that can be tracked, correlated, or used against them.

## How it works

### For publishers (donees)

1. Go to [Create Paylink](/paylinks/create)
2. Enter your **Monero primary address** and **private view key**
3. Configure optional settings (label, index range)
4. Get a **Donate button** snippet to embed on your site

The private view key is stored encrypted on the server and used **only** to derive receive-only subaddresses. We never ask for your spend key — we can't move your funds.

### For donors

1. Click the Donate button on the publisher's site
2. Optionally enter an amount and description
3. Receive a fresh **subaddress** and **QR code**
4. Send the payment using your Monero wallet app

## What makes it different?

### No persistent address

Traditional donation buttons expose a single wallet address that:
- Can be tracked on the blockchain
- Can be correlated with other payments
- Creates a permanent link between you and your donors

Paylinks generates a fresh subaddress for each donation request, breaking that chain.

### No wallet exposure

You never share your spend key. The server only has your view key (encrypted), which can generate receiving addresses but cannot spend funds.

### No metadata stored

We don't log:
- Donor IP addresses
- Payment amounts
- Timestamps
- Descriptions

The payment metadata exists only in the donor's browser during the request.

## Important distinction

**Paylinks** is a separate tool from **Payment Requests** inside Anonomi Messenger.

| Feature | Paylinks | Messenger Payment Requests |
|---------|----------|---------------------------|
| Use case | Public donation buttons | Private peer-to-peer payments |
| Audience | Publishers with websites | Contacts in secure conversations |
| Address generation | Server-side (view key) | Client-side (in wallet) |

If you're exchanging payment info with a trusted contact, use Messenger. If you need a public donation button, use Paylinks.

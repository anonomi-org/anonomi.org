title: Clearnet and Tor Separation
description: Why Anonomi Paylinks runs separate services for clearnet and Tor.
---

Anonomi Paylinks operates **separate services** for clearnet (regular internet) and Tor (onion services). This is intentional and designed to maximize security for users in hostile environments.

---

## Why separate services?

### No cross-origin requests

When you create a Paylink on the clearnet website (`anonomi.org`), it communicates with the clearnet API (`paylinksd.anonomi.org`). When you use the onion website, it communicates with the onion API.

We do **not** allow cross-origin requests between clearnet and Tor. This means:
- The clearnet site cannot talk to the onion API
- The onion site cannot talk to the clearnet API

This prevents several attack vectors and metadata leaks.

### Traffic isolation

If you're using Tor for privacy, your browser should only communicate with onion services. Allowing the onion website to contact clearnet APIs would:
- Route traffic through Tor exit nodes (which can be monitored)
- Potentially expose your activity to clearnet infrastructure
- Defeat the purpose of using Tor in the first place

### Independent infrastructure

The clearnet and onion services run on separate infrastructure. If one is compromised or taken down, the other continues to operate independently.

## What this means for you

### Creating a Paylink

| If you want... | Use this website |
|----------------|------------------|
| Donate button for clearnet | `anonomi.org/paylinks/create` |
| Donate button for Tor | `[onion]/paylinks/create` |

The donate button you create will point to the same network you created it on.

### For donors

Donors clicking your button will be directed to the same network (clearnet or onion) where the button was created. This ensures their traffic stays within the expected network path.

## Onion addresses

**Website:**
```
http://ucvmhctoq76k6qrdrvblxspjpk5rpjutsfe6nxyhgmvx25vruohxrnqd.onion/
```

**Paylinks (create):**
```
http://ucvmhctoq76k6qrdrvblxspjpk5rpjutsfe6nxyhgmvx25vruohxrnqd.onion/paylinks/create
```

---

## Summary

- **Clearnet users**: Create paylinks on `anonomi.org`
- **Tor users**: Create paylinks on the onion website
- **Never mix**: Don't expect clearnet pages to work with onion APIs or vice versa

This separation is a security feature, not a limitation.

title: Threat model
description: What Anonomi is designed to protect against — and what it explicitly cannot.
---

Anonomi is built for **high-risk and hostile environments**, not for abstract or idealized security models.

This page explains the assumptions Anonomi makes, the risks it aims to reduce, and the limits you must understand before relying on it.

Security is a *system property* — not a feature toggle.

---

## Core assumptions

Anonomi assumes that, at some point, one or more of the following may be true:

- Network traffic is monitored or logged
- Internet access is filtered, blocked, or manipulated
- Metadata is more valuable to adversaries than message content
- Devices may be inspected, seized, or accessed under coercion
- Some contacts may become compromised over time
- You may be forced to unlock or interact with your device

The design assumes **pressure**, not goodwill.

## What Anonomi is designed to reduce

Anonomi focuses on reducing *structural* risks rather than promising total anonymity.

Specifically, it aims to reduce:

### Metadata exposure
- No centralized servers to log who talks to whom
- No third-party services embedded into core workflows
- Offline modes that generate no network traffic at all

### Central points of failure
- No accounts tied to phone numbers or email addresses
- No reliance on always-available infrastructure
- No dependence on app stores for installation or updates

### Risk from forced connectivity
- Ability to operate fully offline
- Explicit control over when and how the internet is used
- Predictable network behavior (no silent background connections)

---

## What Anonomi does **not** protect against

Anonomi is not a magic shield.

It **cannot** protect you from:

### A compromised device
- Malware, spyware, or hostile firmware
- Modified or backdoored operating systems
- Devices managed by employers, schools, or authorities (MDM)

If the device itself is compromised, software defenses are limited.

---

### User behavior and identity disclosure
- Revealing personal information in messages
- Reusing identities across unsafe contexts
- Communicating patterns that identify you socially or physically

Privacy tools cannot override unsafe behavior.

---

### Compromised endpoints
- If the person you are talking to is compromised
- If messages are read under coercion on either side
- If screenshots, recordings, or manual copying occur

End-to-end encryption does not protect against *the person at the keyboard*.

---

## Threat model in practice

Anonomi is built around **risk reduction**, not absolutes.

It works best when combined with:
- Careful operational security
- Context-appropriate connection choices
- Realistic expectations about adversaries and pressure

Use it as part of a strategy — not as the strategy.

---

## From threat model to action

A threat model is only useful if it informs real decisions.

Anonomi is designed to give you multiple ways to communicate because
different situations require different tradeoffs. Choosing the wrong
mode at the wrong time can increase risk rather than reduce it.

The scenarios section translates this threat model into concrete,
real-world choices.

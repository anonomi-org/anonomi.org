title: What is Anonomi?
description: What Anonomi is, how it works, and what assumptions it makes.
---

Anonomi is a **privacy-focused communication suite** designed to resist surveillance, centralization, and infrastructure capture through its technical architecture.

### 1) Anonomi Messenger (Android app)
The main app: decentralized messaging that can work **over Tor** or **fully offline**. Provides secure messaging (including voice messages), with built-in features for
offline location sharing and in-chat Monero payment requests.

### 2) Maps Exporter (web tool)
A tool that generates **offline map tile packs locally** (in your browser), so you can later import them into Anonomi Messenger for offline use.

### 3) Paylinks (tool/site)
Tool for creating **privacy-preserving donation/payment links** (intended for publishing). *(In development)*

Together, these tools are designed to avoid the common failure mode where “secure” features depend on unsafe external platforms.

For the political and ethical motivations behind these choices, see the [Manifesto](/docs/manifesto).

## Design assumptions

Anonomi is built around a small set of explicit assumptions:

- Networks may be monitored, filtered, or manipulated
- Infrastructure may be seized, altered, or shut down
- Platforms and intermediaries may act under coercion
- Users may operate under varying levels of risk

These conditions are treated as **normal operating environments**, not exceptional cases.

---

## Architecture over policy

Anonomi does not depend on:

- Centralized servers
- Global directories
- Account-based identity systems
- External mapping or payment platforms
- Recovery mechanisms tied to third-party providers

Instead, communication and coordination happen directly between peers, using whatever transport is safest under current conditions.

This reduces single points of failure and limits the amount of metadata that can be collected, correlated, or coerced from intermediaries.

---

## Network resilience

Anonomi is designed to function across:

- Unreliable or degraded networks
- Filtered or censored connections
- Environments where direct internet access is unsafe or unavailable

Support for Tor and offline-first operation is foundational, not optional.

When conditions change, the system prioritizes **continuity of use** over reliance on any single network path.

---

## Open source and forkability

Anonomi is open source so that:

- Security claims can be independently verified
- Control does not rest with a single organization
- The project remains forkable if governance or direction diverges

Users are not required to trust maintainers indefinitely.

---

## Limits and responsibility

Anonomi improves privacy and resilience, but it does not eliminate risk.

It cannot protect against:

- Compromised devices or operating systems
- Malware or malicious input methods
- Users voluntarily revealing identifying information

Using Anonomi responsibly requires understanding both its strengths and its limits.

---

## Who Anonomi is suitable for

Anonomi is suitable for users who:

- Want communication tools that do not rely on centralized identity
- Need systems that remain usable under changing or hostile network conditions
- Prefer transparency and user control over convenience-driven platforms

No specialized technical expertise is required.

title: Maps Exporter (beta)
description: Export offline map tiles locally in your browser.
---

## Overview

Maps Exporter generates offline map tile packs **locally in your browser**.

Everything happens on your device:
selection, downloading, packaging, and saving.

- No accounts  
- No uploads  
- No analytics  
- No server-side processing  

Open it here:
- **[Maps Exporter](/maps)**

---

## How it works

1. Select a map tile source  
2. Move and zoom the map to define the export area  
3. Select a zoom detail level or set a custom range  
4. Export tiles as a ZIP file  

The **visible map area** is the export boundary.

---

## Map sources

No map tiles are loaded until you explicitly select a source.

Available presets include:
- OpenStreetMap (test / standard)
- OpenTopoMap
- CARTO Positron
- CARTO Dark Matter (dark)

You may also provide a **Custom** tile source by entering a tile URL template.

---

## Privacy notice

Tile sources are contacted **directly by your browser**.

When using Tor, this may involve **Tor exit traffic** unless you use an **onion-based tile source**.

Maps Exporter itself:
- Does not proxy requests
- Does not log usage
- Does not store data remotely

## Zoom levels

### Presets

- **Low**: zoom levels 0 to 8  
- **Medium**: zoom levels 0 to 12  
- **High**: zoom levels 0 to 16  

### Advanced

Enable *Advanced* to set an exact zoom range manually.

Higher zoom levels significantly increase:
- Download time
- Disk usage
- Memory consumption during export
- File size (exponentially, as each level quadruples the tile count)

For a detailed explanation of zoom levels, including their impact on file sizes and performance, see [Zoom Levels Explained](/docs/reference/zoom-levels-explained).

---

## Export controls

During export you can:
- Pause and resume downloading
- Stop and pack already downloaded tiles
- Cancel the export entirely

Progress indicators include:
- Percentage completed
- Number of tiles downloaded
- Total downloaded size
- Elapsed runtime

---

## Output format

The exported ZIP contains:

- A directory hierarchy of tiles organized by zoom, X, and Y
- A metadata file describing:
  - Bounding box
  - Zoom levels
  - Tile source
  - Creation timestamp

This format is compatible with Anonomi Offline Maps.

---

## Notes on tile usage

Public tile servers are intended for **light usage only**.

For large areas or high zoom levels, consider:
- Running your own tile server
- Using a provider that allows bulk downloads
- Respecting provider rate limits and usage policies
